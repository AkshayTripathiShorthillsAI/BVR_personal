Works well on small cuts of meat, but may need to have a heavier knife when getting into larger cut of meat.

I hold the knives edge-up under running water in my sink with my left hand, and lightly move the sharpener with my right hand along the blade.  About 10 very light strokes is usually enough to touch up an already fairly sharp knife.  For me, that is much easier than any sharpener you need to place on a countertop, and pull the knife through (and the Smith sharpener is safer for the countertop, which Ive nicked and scratched trying to sharpen long chefs knives using other sharpeners)."", > A few other reviewers claim that the ceramic rods broke when they were trying to sharpen knives --- if so, they were using WAY too much pressure.  Use only a very light touch., ""> Generally speaking the carbide (metal) side should NEVER be used on chefs knives or other fine blades.  The carbide takes off too much metal.  In quality knives, only the very edge is treated to be hard enough to hold a very sharp edge --- grind that off (or scrape it off with a carbide sharpener), and all the sharpening in the world is a waste of time.  A couple of other reviewers claim that the carbide chips fine blades -- in which case the blades are permanently ruined."", > Use the carbide side for axes, machetes, and other utility blades made of comparatively softer steel.  But even a utility blade can be damaged by using too much pressure with a carbide sharpener --- the edge of the blade becomes wavy and irregular.  You can touch them up (make them a little sharper) using the ceramic edge afterward --- but that extra step is usually a waste of time for utility blades, which will dull quickly in use anyway., >  Maybe ""medium quality"" blades (such as an average quality hunting knife) might benefit from carbide followed by ceramic, but try the ceramic only, first.  If, say 30, swipes with the ceramic side does not adequately sharpen the knife, then try 5 light swipes with the carbide sharpener, followed by 20 light swipes with the ceramic., > There is another option for truly fine blades -- a honer.  If you see a chef ""wiping"" two chef's knives against each other, that's what he/she is doing -- honing.  But it is better to use a honing rod (and follow the instructions which come with it, or watch a u-tube video).  Honing straightens up microscopically bent or folded portions of the edge, and can dramatically ""sharpen"" a knife without removing any metal.  If you use a honer, maybe once in 5 or 10 times you hone the knife, you'll probably need to sharpen it with a ceramic sharpener -- albeit only a few strokes, 10 at most., > Caution, large rod-like ceramic sharpeners are sometimes described as (or sold as) ""honers"" -- maybe they hone and sharpen at the same time, but, if so, they are removing metal from your blade.  The purpose of a honer (or a leather barber's strop) is to sharpen without removing metal.  I recommend using a metal honer, followed (if necessary) by minimal sharpening with a ceramic sharpener., ""> How can you tell when a chefs knife is sharp?

The coarse slot brings dull edges back to life, while the fine slot hones and polishes, resulting in remarkably sharp knives., Ease of Use: Its straightforward design makes it user-friendly. Even those new to knife sharpening will find the process simple and hassle-free., Compact and Practical Design: The size is ideal for kitchen storage, fitting easily into a drawer. The non-slip base adds stability and safety during use., Great Value: For its price, the performance of this sharpener is impressive. It offers an excellent balance of quality and affordability, making it accessible for most budgets., Cons:, Limited Versatility: While it works wonderfully for standard kitchen knives, it may not be suitable for more specialized or premium knives., Not Instantaneous: There‚Äôs a slight learning curve, and it takes a bit of time to achieve the desired sharpness, especially for very dull knives., Build Quality: While adequate for the price, the build doesn‚Äôt feel particularly premium. Long-term durability might be a concern for heavy users., Manual Operation: Some might find the manual sharpening process less convenient compared to electric sharpeners, especially for sharpening multiple knives., ""In conclusion, the Smiths CCKS 2-Step Knife Sharpener is a fantastic option for those seeking an easy, effective, and budget-friendly solution for maintaining their kitchen knives. It strikes a solid balance between functionality and cost, making it a worthwhile investment for casual cooks and culinary enthusiasts looking for a quick and simple way to keep their blades in top condition.""","{'feature': 'Blade quality of kitchen-knife-accessories', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The sharpener effectively revitalizes dull blades.

I hold the knives edge-up under running water in my sink with my left hand, and lightly move the sharpener with my right hand along the blade.  About 10 very light strokes is usually enough to touch up an already fairly sharp knife.  For me, that is much easier than any sharpener you need to place on a countertop, and pull the knife through (and the Smith sharpener is safer for the countertop, which Ive nicked and scratched trying to sharpen long chefs knives using other sharpeners)."", > A few other reviewers claim that the ceramic rods broke when they were trying to sharpen knives --- if so, they were using WAY too much pressure.  Use only a very light touch., ""> Generally speaking the carbide (metal) side should NEVER be used on chefs knives or other fine blades.  The carbide takes off too much metal.  In quality knives, only the very edge is treated to be hard enough to hold a very sharp edge --- grind that off (or scrape it off with a carbide sharpener), and all the sharpening in the world is a waste of time.  A couple of other reviewers claim that the carbide chips fine blades -- in which case the blades are permanently ruined."", > Use the carbide side for axes, machetes, and other utility blades made of comparatively softer steel.  But even a utility blade can be damaged by using too much pressure with a carbide sharpener --- the edge of the blade becomes wavy and irregular.  You can touch them up (make them a little sharper) using the ceramic edge afterward --- but that extra step is usually a waste of time for utility blades, which will dull quickly in use anyway., >  Maybe ""medium quality"" blades (such as an average quality hunting knife) might benefit from carbide followed by ceramic, but try the ceramic only, first.  If, say 30, swipes with the ceramic side does not adequately sharpen the knife, then try 5 light swipes with the carbide sharpener, followed by 20 light swipes with the ceramic., > There is another option for truly fine blades -- a honer.  If you see a chef ""wiping"" two chef's knives against each other, that's what he/she is doing -- honing.  But it is better to use a honing rod (and follow the instructions which come with it, or watch a u-tube video).  Honing straightens up microscopically bent or folded portions of the edge, and can dramatically ""sharpen"" a knife without removing any metal.  If you use a honer, maybe once in 5 or 10 times you hone the knife, you'll probably need to sharpen it with a ceramic sharpener -- albeit only a few strokes, 10 at most., > Caution, large rod-like ceramic sharpeners are sometimes described as (or sold as) ""honers"" -- maybe they hone and sharpen at the same time, but, if so, they are removing metal from your blade.  The purpose of a honer (or a leather barber's strop) is to sharpen without removing metal.  I recommend using a metal honer, followed (if necessary) by minimal sharpening with a ceramic sharpener., ""> How can you tell when a chefs knife is sharp?  If (with a light sawing motion) the blade can cut a ripe tomato without depressing the skin, then it is sharp."", > Do NOT use on scissors, garden sheers, or grafting blades, or any other blades that are sharpened on only one side.","{'feature': 'Blade quality of kitchen-knife-accessories', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Generally speaking the carbide (metal) side should NEVER be used on chefs knives or other fine blades.

This was the answer to my problem!  

It is free standing and has a very strong magnet to hold knives on both sides of the holder.  

Yes, I do have to hold onto the holder when I remove the larger knives due to the strength of the magnets, otherwise it will tip over.  

The smaller knives are no problem.

Quality is amazing.

Even the tool they give you to assemble is a quality product.

The magnetic is strong and pulls the knife to the board.

My primary concern was that it would take one hand pulling the knife and the other to stabilize the board.

Well I was wrong magnetic pulls the knife to the board and removing the knife was as gentle as someone handing it to you!!
