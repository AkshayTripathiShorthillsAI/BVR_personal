Efficient.

Clear.

Clean.

Tonally these are pretty smooth too.  

Use these filtered at about 200 hz or higher.

They have minimum excursion.

Will distort if you try to run full range or midbass.

Good value.

,  These are a pro audio style speaker.

Not a car audio style speaker.

Frame size is standard for pro.

This is a custom install speaker.

Not drop in door replacement.

, Good speaker when used properly.

The selector shows almost any 6.5-6.75"" speaker should work.  Until I took the door apart I didn't know my car has speakers that come with an adapter about 1"" high built into the speakers.  Very easy to get the door panel off and remove the speakers after watching a youtube video.  Very disappointed I didn't do more research into my speakers and possible adapters before I ordered.  I did check Crutchfield and considered ordering from there because they give an adapter and wiring connector with the speakers, but the adapter is essentially flat and just gets the speaker to mount flat to the door without bringing it out to the door panel like the factory speakers and some noted that the sound was not great with the speaker 1"" away from the inside of the door panel, and the magnet may interfere with the window.  I decided to make it work with what I had.  I am an engineer and I am very handy but it took several hours to cut apart the factory speakers so I could use the ring to space the new speakers out so they would be installed against the back of the door panel as the factory speakers were.  I used a cutting wheel on my Dremel to cut apart the factory speakers, and a drill mounted drum sander to smooth out the rough edges.  I used 3M VHB tape between the new speaker and the riser then pre-drilled and used screws to mount the speakers.  With some crimp spade connectors I was able to use the factory wiring connector on the riser to connect the new speakers.  Replacing these speakers with new ones would be a breeze now as I have adapted the mounting and wiring.  I think the 2008 Hyundai Entourage minivan and the Kia Sedona minivan have the same doors so probably the same speakers so Kia folks will probably have the same issue.  Maybe there are decent adapters you can buy that mount right up, but I didn't find them.  All said and done, the sound from the first one (just installed, not ""broken in"") was the same as the sound from the still-working factory speaker on the other door.  Time will tell if these sound better after some use.  I didn't know that was a thing, breaking-in speakers by using them.  I took a few pics as I went showing the factory speaker with the wiring connector and stand-off riser part built in.  Also included a pic showing the finished thing in the door.  I had some foam insulation tape I put around the edge over the speaker screws to mimic what the factory speakers had to kind of close the gap between the front of the speaker and the inside of the door panel.","{'feature': 'Installation Ease of car-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Very easy to get the door panel off and remove the speakers after watching a youtube video', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user found it very easy to remove the door panel and replace the speakers after watching a youtube video.

Between the advertised high end price points of some brands and the supreme disappointment in other bargain speakers you can get left wondering how the trial and error period ever truly ends. Skar Audio is a great place to go if you are wanting amazing sound, whether you’ve been disappointed before or are lucky enough not yo have done all the searching. I bought two pairs but not at the same time. I replaced some JL audio 6.5’s in my front doors of my SUV and it’s night and day. Everything about them is better. Bigger beefier housing and the magnet is a tank compared. The sound is not even in the same league. I loved them so much I went to purchase two more for the back speakers and that’s lead me to replace my dome tweeters with Skar Audio as well. Skar even makes shallow mount subs that I believe I will try next but I’m in no hurry. I have tons of bass that hits and wiggles your seat enough with also solid mid and high range as well. Nothing gets muddy or distorted or sound like an inexperienced 16 year old is messing around with only the bass knob on the EQ at full blast. It sounds big, bold and balanced. I don’t have an overpowered head unit or even an amp or crossover. Just a nice 16 band graphic EQ built into the head unit that makes these babies perfect to pair with any music type. Extreme volume, mid or low ranges are all perfect too. Aside from a company sending me speakers to demo for free, I’m not willing to consider switching from Skar anytime soon.","{'feature': 'Compatibility of car-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'I replaced some JL audio 6.5’s in my front doors of my SUV and it’s night and day.

Sound quality is decent and certainly much better than the original factory installed speakers.  My wife keeps the volume at a medium level & does not set the bass setting high, so the use is medium.  So for a non-audiophile, its a great choice, considering it is a good brand name at a reasonable price.  Most of the choices I found on Amazon were either pricey or unknown brands.  These seemed to meet our needs most closely.  I have no regrets & would definitely buy them again.  Theyve only been in the car a few weeks, so I cant speak for longevity.  Installation was not too difficulty, but that is more of a function with each persons specific vehicle.  I only wish they made the holes around the speaker rim align with the existing screw holes in the car door.  I did have to drill 4 holes to hold each speaker in place.  Yes, I would recommend these speakers as a good, solid speaker for general use.  I cannot provide feed back on systems with big amps, over-bassing your music, etc.  BTW, our speakers did come with the free corded earbuds in the box.

I needed to up my music game and have a decent speaker capable of handling good audio quality with the top down (you loose volume when the sound isnt contained within the cabin by the roof/sides of your car)."", The smartest thing Jeep did was put speakers attached to the roll bar (a sound bar on the roll bar, wish it was a serve drinks bar too :p ) which is great for minimizing sound loss when opened up., So for the sound bar I wanted to get at least a 3 way speaker systems. The kickers can still be sort of heard, the pillar tweeters are hard to hear, when the top is down, I wanted to get all that at head level., These are wow in there! I am an audio snob, really hard impress, but these impressed me., ""Im using an aftermarket head unit, and though it says it has enough power for the speakers, I question it (I never liked the head unit it might be replaced soon). But I will guess that most head units arent powerful enough. I think the speakers really needs an amp (which is next on my list)."", What is best about the Pioneers:, They put out sound. Really good sound even at higher volumes., ""With the stock speakers, I had to crank it once the soft top was down. Driving around town (no more than 40mph) I lost a lot of quality; the mid range especially (stock speakers were bad at that, period). The Pioneers arent losing sound nearly as much. I dont really need to crank them up top down."", ""Then yesterday... They got the ultimate test. First time on the highway with the top down (I usually dont like driving on the highway top down. Way too much wind)."", ""At 65mph, its going to be harder to hear sound no matter how good your speakers are. But they did fantastic. Yes I had to turn up the volume. But I could hear it very well all things considered. A+ for the highway driving."", Sound quality stuff:, ""All it took was a quick tweak in the head unit settings to get the right power to the speakers and it was giving me a loud, clear sound within the entire frequency range (dont just adjust your equalizer. Adjust all the settings if you have access to them)."", The stereo effects are much better than what I had in the stock speakers. Songs that I ""sort of heard"" the music sliding from right to left or vise versa were very pronounced. I think that it's because the Pioneers have much better mid range., These are really mid range woofers. So if you are expecting ground shaking bass, you probably will be disappointed. However, they have some of the lowest bass frequencies of all the mid bass drivers I was looking at. They can get some deep bass., ""However, you are likely to start losing quality if you go too low. This is the nature of the mid bass speaker. Want lower and you need a subwoofer (also next on my list). Each driver has a job. And low bass frequency is not a mid bass drivers job."", However, the bass it handles it does fantastically. The mid range is beautiful. I was hearing a lot more mid range vocals than before. For test songs on that the vocals (by the same artist), in lower male vocal range and mid male vocal range, and he was sounding full and nuanced., ""High range was falling off on my stock speakers, the tweeters on the Pioneers picked up female vocal range beautifully. Crisp without being shrill. They really move through the low/mid/highs very naturally. At high volumes I do get a bit of shrill on the very high end of the tweeters, but I think that can be adjusted (its very high on the frequency range, I dont hear that high in many songs)."", Technical stuff:, ""I purchased wiring harnesses so not to have to deal with fussing with wiring, the speakers slid right into the harnesses, the harnesses into the Jeeps harnesses and it was good to go."", ""The adaptor rings didnt quite work. Maybe they would have, but there was no clear instructions on them on how to get them in the space or what to do. That is the *only* fault I have with them."", ""I totally, totally recommend these speakers. For uses such as a Jeeps sound bar, they are perfect. Just keep in mind what theyre for. Theyre all around workhorse speakers, they do everything, and they do it well. These will up your game for in dash speakers or rear speakers.

I needed to up my music game and have a decent speaker capable of handling good audio quality with the top down (you loose volume when the sound isnt contained within the cabin by the roof/sides of your car)."", The smartest thing Jeep did was put speakers attached to the roll bar (a sound bar on the roll bar, wish it was a serve drinks bar too :p ) which is great for minimizing sound loss when opened up., So for the sound bar I wanted to get at least a 3 way speaker systems. The kickers can still be sort of heard, the pillar tweeters are hard to hear, when the top is down, I wanted to get all that at head level., These are wow in there! I am an audio snob, really hard impress, but these impressed me., ""Im using an aftermarket head unit, and though it says it has enough power for the speakers, I question it (I never liked the head unit it might be replaced soon). But I will guess that most head units arent powerful enough. I think the speakers really needs an amp (which is next on my list)."", What is best about the Pioneers:, They put out sound. Really good sound even at higher volumes., ""With the stock speakers, I had to crank it once the soft top was down. Driving around town (no more than 40mph) I lost a lot of quality; the mid range especially (stock speakers were bad at that, period). The Pioneers arent losing sound nearly as much. I dont really need to crank them up top down."", ""Then yesterday... They got the ultimate test. First time on the highway with the top down (I usually dont like driving on the highway top down.

But I could hear it very well all things considered. A+ for the highway driving."", Sound quality stuff:, ""All it took was a quick tweak in the head unit settings to get the right power to the speakers and it was giving me a loud, clear sound within the entire frequency range (dont just adjust your equalizer. Adjust all the settings if you have access to them)."", The stereo effects are much better than what I had in the stock speakers. Songs that I ""sort of heard"" the music sliding from right to left or vise versa were very pronounced. I think that it's because the Pioneers have much better mid range., These are really mid range woofers. So if you are expecting ground shaking bass, you probably will be disappointed. However, they have some of the lowest bass frequencies of all the mid bass drivers I was looking at. They can get some deep bass., ""However, you are likely to start losing quality if you go too low. This is the nature of the mid bass speaker. Want lower and you need a subwoofer (also next on my list). Each driver has a job. And low bass frequency is not a mid bass drivers job."", However, the bass it handles it does fantastically. The mid range is beautiful. I was hearing a lot more mid range vocals than before. For test songs on that the vocals (by the same artist), in lower male vocal range and mid male vocal range, and he was sounding full and nuanced., ""High range was falling off on my stock speakers, the tweeters on the Pioneers picked up female vocal range beautifully. Crisp without being shrill. They really move through the low/mid/highs very naturally. At high volumes I do get a bit of shrill on the very high end of the tweeters, but I think that can be adjusted (its very high on the frequency range, I dont hear that high in many songs)."", Technical stuff:, ""I purchased wiring harnesses so not to have to deal with fussing with wiring, the speakers slid right into the harnesses, the harnesses into the Jeeps harnesses and it was good to go."", ""The adaptor rings didnt quite work.
