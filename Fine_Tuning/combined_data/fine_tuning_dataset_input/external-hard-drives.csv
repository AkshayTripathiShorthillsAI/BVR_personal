I use MANY internal/external hard drives and Ive had very good luck with most of them.  While i cant say how long any hard drive will last because much of it depends on how you use and handle it.  If you dont beat them up with dropping them or big temperature extremes Ive had my WD hard drives last me for over 10 years.  The internal drives tend to have a shorter life since they are subject to more intense use but even mine have lasted for well over 5 years or more of heavy use.  I have in use many 14, 16, 18tb size WD drives including this one in operation.  I disconnect my external drives when Im not using them since it will likely help them to last longer I believe.

        }",3,0.0060265,8.007829666137695,https://amazon.com/dp/B0874XJL6M,"I’m not the most tech savvy and wanted backup on an external drive for graphics heavy work and photos.  I remember the challenge of making my last external drive compatible and especially deleting old files, so I was a little anxious trying to find a solution., In case it helps someone else, I work primarily on an iPad Pro in a design program (Affinity) and needed a backup storage solution besides the Cloud.  I didn’t really want a second cloud solution to be backup and can’t use an external drive with the iPad.  I also have a MacBook, which has massive storage, but can’t be backed up to ICloud, while the ipad can backup to iCloud.  My workaround for immediate file saving is to create shared files which are stored on iCloud (I call them Desktop) on the ipad.  Desktop is stored on the hard drive of the MacBook and gets updated via ICloud device sharing even though I can’t initiate an iCloud backup from the MacBook., Inside Desktop I have labeled files as usual and a parent file for graphic design from the Ipad, broken down into 100+ named project files and sub files.  Whenever I save from the ipad, I save to Desktop (in iCloud) and then choose the appropriate file within Desktop to save.  This way I have the folders on the hard drive of the MacBook as interim backup, and am working around not having iCloud backup storage available when I’m on the MacBook.  The T7 comes in as secure and portable physical data storage., The T7 drive is the hard copy backup of the files shared between the iPad and MacBook, I think necessary in case of some dreadful software issue, fire, or other unanticipated loss of access.  I plan to have more than one as soon as I can afford it, to rotate., Again hopefully this may help someone like me who spent some solid hours figuring out a better way to secure my data and workaround the Mac user experience., Since I am wanted to do manual backups I needed the process to be easy so I wouldn’t avoid doing them, for obvious reasons.  Though we don’t need to get into it here I don’t want to use Time Machine on my Mac to back up the disk.  So I had to figure out something else., The T7 is great, easy to use, no time at all to install, self explanatory pretty much.  I dragged folders full of work from the desktop (yes I like to see them, don’t judge) to backup.  The initial backup was very quick and painless, most files were a few seconds.  The graphics heavy files perhaps took about 10 minutes?  These are massive, not a problem, and may have been quicker than this, I expected it to take more time.  (My last iCloud backup was over 13 hours of anxiety - I kid you not and have since deleted almost all the working files from the drawing app after saving them in Desktop so they happen more quickly now, but still, I thought this was a daylong project).,  I experimented with dragging an old file to the trash from the T7 disk pane, and it worked as expected.  I had to read online about how to go about copying my photos library (Mac) to disk, but it wasn’t hard.  I have over 40,000 images, and it took about 20 minutes as I recall, if longer probably max 25.  I tested the backup by remaining in the open pane and opening the photo files, which worked.  Amazingly all this data barely touches the capacity of the drive, maybe 10% or less of a TB?  Minuscule, anyway.  2 TB is overkill for me, especially since old files can easily be deleted., (This may be different for a user in Time Machine because it keeps multiple versions of your backups, and maybe more settings etc. which can take up a lot of space?-  not tech savvy, as I said, but I had trouble with my older system and Time Machine and being unable to delete backups which rendered my backup disk unusable, and I didn’t want to deal with this again even though it’s less convenient to do it manually)., I think the T7 drive will fail before I need more space, which is a great problem to have.  I’m planning to get another disk (with less storage) and use it as a failsafe backup- ideally storing it in a safe or out of the house just in case, and keeping a rotation to protect against loss., On the critical end, I’d love it and think it would be much safer for data if the user pane of the T7 was visibly different from the one on my desktop.  It’s the same color, font, everything, as my desktop window (maybe that’s just how these things work?), which makes me triple check when I’m deleting or updating.  Don’t do this on a Friday night after an adult beverage…., I’d also love it if there was a simple tutorial available when you opened the disk up, just for ease of first use, a how to  (experimented with a throwaway file deleting because it wasn’t obvious that dragging files to the trash would work) for most, and as a reminder for others.  I hesitate getting one for my parents because of this.  But I’m happy and will buy another, looking forward to the peace of mind it gives me.","{'feature': 'compatibility of external-hard-drives', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The T7 comes in as secure and portable physical data storage', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user has mentioned that T7 external hard drive is secure and portable physical data storage.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",compatibility,The user has mentioned that T7 external hard drive is secure and portable physical data storage.,,T7 external hard drive is a secure and portable physical data storage.,321486,YES,T7 external hard drive is a secure and portable physical data storage.,47,252932,2024-04-03T04:15:43.794540Z,2024-04-03T04:15:43.794588Z,9.375

        }",1,0.006096,8.963645219802856,https://amazon.com/dp/B0874XJL6M,"I’m not the most tech savvy and wanted backup on an external drive for graphics heavy work and photos.  I remember the challenge of making my last external drive compatible and especially deleting old files, so I was a little anxious trying to find a solution., In case it helps someone else, I work primarily on an iPad Pro in a design program (Affinity) and needed a backup storage solution besides the Cloud.  I didn’t really want a second cloud solution to be backup and can’t use an external drive with the iPad.  I also have a MacBook, which has massive storage, but can’t be backed up to ICloud, while the ipad can backup to iCloud.  My workaround for immediate file saving is to create shared files which are stored on iCloud (I call them Desktop) on the ipad.  Desktop is stored on the hard drive of the MacBook and gets updated via ICloud device sharing even though I can’t initiate an iCloud backup from the MacBook., Inside Desktop I have labeled files as usual and a parent file for graphic design from the Ipad, broken down into 100+ named project files and sub files.  Whenever I save from the ipad, I save to Desktop (in iCloud) and then choose the appropriate file within Desktop to save.  This way I have the folders on the hard drive of the MacBook as interim backup, and am working around not having iCloud backup storage available when I’m on the MacBook.  The T7 comes in as secure and portable physical data storage., The T7 drive is the hard copy backup of the files shared between the iPad and MacBook, I think necessary in case of some dreadful software issue, fire, or other unanticipated loss of access.  I plan to have more than one as soon as I can afford it, to rotate., Again hopefully this may help someone like me who spent some solid hours figuring out a better way to secure my data and workaround the Mac user experience., Since I am wanted to do manual backups I needed the process to be easy so I wouldn’t avoid doing them, for obvious reasons.  Though we don’t need to get into it here I don’t want to use Time Machine on my Mac to back up the disk.  So I had to figure out something else., The T7 is great, easy to use, no time at all to install, self explanatory pretty much.  I dragged folders full of work from the desktop (yes I like to see them, don’t judge) to backup.  The initial backup was very quick and painless, most files were a few seconds.  The graphics heavy files perhaps took about 10 minutes?  These are massive, not a problem, and may have been quicker than this, I expected it to take more time.  (My last iCloud backup was over 13 hours of anxiety - I kid you not and have since deleted almost all the working files from the drawing app after saving them in Desktop so they happen more quickly now, but still, I thought this was a daylong project).,  I experimented with dragging an old file to the trash from the T7 disk pane, and it worked as expected.  I had to read online about how to go about copying my photos library (Mac) to disk, but it wasn’t hard.  I have over 40,000 images, and it took about 20 minutes as I recall, if longer probably max 25.  I tested the backup by remaining in the open pane and opening the photo files, which worked.  Amazingly all this data barely touches the capacity of the drive, maybe 10% or less of a TB?  Minuscule, anyway.  2 TB is overkill for me, especially since old files can easily be deleted., (This may be different for a user in Time Machine because it keeps multiple versions of your backups, and maybe more settings etc. which can take up a lot of space?-  not tech savvy, as I said, but I had trouble with my older system and Time Machine and being unable to delete backups which rendered my backup disk unusable, and I didn’t want to deal with this again even though it’s less convenient to do it manually)., I think the T7 drive will fail before I need more space, which is a great problem to have.  I’m planning to get another disk (with less storage) and use it as a failsafe backup- ideally storing it in a safe or out of the house just in case, and keeping a rotation to protect against loss., On the critical end, I’d love it and think it would be much safer for data if the user pane of the T7 was visibly different from the one on my desktop.  It’s the same color, font, everything, as my desktop window (maybe that’s just how these things work?), which makes me triple check when I’m deleting or updating.  Don’t do this on a Friday night after an adult beverage…., I’d also love it if there was a simple tutorial available when you opened the disk up, just for ease of first use, a how to  (experimented with a throwaway file deleting because it wasn’t obvious that dragging files to the trash would work) for most, and as a reminder for others.  I hesitate getting one for my parents because of this.  But I’m happy and will buy another, looking forward to the peace of mind it gives me.","{'feature': 'backup software of external-hard-drives', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The T7 is great, easy to use, no time at all to install, self explanatory pretty much.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user has mentioned that the T7 external hard drive is great, easy to use, and self-explanatory.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",backup software,"The user has mentioned that the T7 external hard drive is great, easy to use, and self-explanatory.",,"The T7 external hard drive is great, easy to use, and self-explanatory.",321482,YES,"The T7 external hard drive is great, easy to use, and self-explanatory.",47,252927,2024-04-03T04:14:59.967023Z,2024-04-03T04:14:59.967071Z,8.279

I did not use the wire connection that came with the drive because too many reviews said it was cheap or it didn’t work properly. I used a USB-C to USB-C connector since my iMac has the port for it. My intention for this drive was to use it as a Time Machine backup. With the computer powered off, I connected the drive to my computer. Then I powered the computer on and logged in. The message that popped up was to the effect of ‘Do you want to use “My Passport for Mac” as a backup for Time Machine?’ I clicked to use it as an automatic backup for Time Machine and it did its thing! I will update if the drive fails or if other problems arise. I did not have to load any WD software, etc. My computer does not hold any sensitive info nor is it partitioned so this was a basic install.","{'feature': 'backup software of external-hard-drives', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'I did not have to load any WD software, etc.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user did not face any problem with respect to backup software while using the external hard drive.

Its like a mini-business, with a fair amount of cash earned from YouTube partnership. As a result, I need a good amount of extra storage space and substantial reliability, though I also need a good price. I thought I found the perfect combination of all of those things with the UnionSine 8TB External Hard Drive.

Then, right when I was about to release arguably my biggest video in months, the hard drive failed. I went to sleep right after I finished the video with the idea that I could just upload it in the morning, but I could not have been more wrong. I turned my computer and external hard drive on, and it sounded substantially different than normal, as though it is no longer turning. It even made my computer turn on and shut off SUBSTANTIALLY slower, which is noticeable as I have an SSD that I use for my OS. It was giving my computer such fits that my computer wouldnt shut off until I removed the USB plug from it that was attached to the UnionSine external hard drive on the other end. Turning on my computer took approximately 10x as long as normal. I tested it to see if it was the failed UnionSine hard drive that was giving it fits, so I booted and shut off my computer WITHOUT the UnionSine external hard drive connected, and it turned on and shut off as normal."", ""In short, I absolutely DEPEND on a quality hard drive that works and can store a good amount of data. This hard drive failed when I needed it most, and I hardly had 25% of the hard drive filled with data. I was probably hovering around 6TB free when it failed, which, along with how quickly it took for this to fail, is incredibly shocking.

Worse yet, I dont even move the UnionSine external hard drive, it stays in the same spot as it has since I first operated it."", I would recommend ANYONE that needs to have reliable storage stay away from UnionSine.

Specifically, the device is no longer being recognized consistently, despite my best efforts to troubleshoot and rectify the problem. This is an especially significant issue for me, as I had a substantial amount of content stored on the device that I feared was irretrievable. However, thanks to my knowledge of data recovery methods and a resourceful online community, I was able to restore the lost content and transfer it to a more reliable drive., I also attempted to perform a complete erase of all data on the device to restart it and potentially resolve the recognition issue. While the erase seemed to be successful at first, it was short-lived, and the device quickly returned to its original state of not being recognized. This has been a disappointing experience for me, especially given that I had opted to invest in a higher-end hard drive, believing that it would be a more dependable and long-lasting choice., ""Its worth noting that hard drives are essential components of any computer system, used to store all manner of important data, ranging from personal documents to business records. As such, its crucial to choose a hard drive that can provide the reliability and durability necessary to safeguard your information. In particular, its essential to consider the type of hard drive youre purchasing, as well as its capacity, transfer speed, and overall performance."", For example, one key factor to consider when selecting a hard drive is its type, with the two primary options being solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are known for being faster, more durable, and less susceptible to damage from physical impacts, making them an excellent choice for users who need high-speed data access or are frequently on the move. On the other hand, HDDs typically offer higher storage capacities at a more affordable price point, making them a more practical choice for users who require vast amounts of storage space for their data., ""In conclusion, my experience with my recent hard drive purchase highlights the importance of carefully considering the features and specifications of any storage device youre considering.
