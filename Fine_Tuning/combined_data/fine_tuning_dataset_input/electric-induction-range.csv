Unfortunately, the carrying case (31115) does not appear to be listed on Amazon :( but the manufacturer sells it for (at present) $14.95 ***PLUS*** another $11.95 in shipping/handling/etc.  $27.00 is a bit too much for a bag, so I may try the PIC Gold's slightly larger case (31111) as that is $18.95 and Free Shipping for Prime Members., Set at 900w, It boiled half a quart of water in a short amount of time, and one of the quick start pages also gives examples of times/wattage.  Going to assume the temp was set to either ""High"" (425F) or ""Max/Sear"" (500F) ., 1 cup water at:  600W  /  900W  /  1,300W, Time:  4:15m  2:00m  1:30m, I finally gave ""cooking soup"" a try, and that would be about 4.75 quarts of veggies and water and such.  The bottom of the pot (usable area) was 7 1/4"", so only 1/2"" was outside the inner ring.  I set the PIC Flex for 380 degrees and after thirty minutes it was showing signs of beginning to boil.  I cheated and pushed it to 400 and it started boiling a few minutes later.  After that, I turned it down to 360 and it was still bubbling away.  I was too much of a coward to try adding the lid as didn't want to risk things spilling over.  Everything worked flawlessly.  The only issue was User Error - I was unaware of the Countdown Timer which I assume defaults at one hour.  I wanted to let it boil for 45 minutes, but my ignoring the timer meant it shut off before this.  I switched it back on and let things finish up.  I pressed the ""clear"" button twice to deactivate the unit, and gave it a few more minutes to let the fan run to exhaust any additional heat.  Then pressed the ""off"" switch on the device (rated for 1800w) that I had the PIC Flex plugged into., ""This unit is smaller than other models, so if one wanted to cook with larger pots/pans, one should opt for a larger NuWave unit.  The benefit of this one is the smaller size, so if one is trying to save space and isnt planning to use larger pots/pans - Get This!  :)"", Combined with the ability to choose your wattage (600w/900w/1300w) and temperature, this is a great all-round single burner for environments where space or power is a concern.  The Countdown Timer is an added safety feature.  Should one get called away, fall asleep, etc, the PIC Flex will shut itself off - less concern of burning food or worse.  Where was this when I was in college?  Hot Plate = Stone Knives & Bear Skins!, Negative Stuff...  :(, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Concerns, =================================, The manual mentions ""This appliance emits an electromagnetic field that is STRONGEST within TWO FEET of the cooking surface.""  The manual also mentions ""Do not place devices or objects that are sensitive to magnetic fields on top of or next to the NuWave(tm) PIC Flex.  (Eg: credit cards, cell phones, radios, TVs, video recorders, etc.).  This may well be ""CYA Boilerplate"" documentation, but still something to consider.  If one exists in the 21st century, then one may have on one's person a cell phone and/or some credit cards.  And if one is operating the PIC Flex without Plastic Man Arms (or a long stick) then one is going to be well inside the ""electromagnetic field that is STRONGEST within TWO FEET of the cooking surface.""  So one could interpret the manual to infer that it might be wiser to keep one's wallet and cell phone ""elsewhere"" when using the PIC Flex., Some Annoyances, ===============, - There is no ""off"" switch so may be using ""Vampire Power"".  As I don't like things that could be switched on by an accidental touch, will be plugging this into something that will function as an ""off"" switch (rated for 1800w)., - Cord is a bit on the short side and comes out from the ""right"" so this limits where one might place the PIC Flex.  If the cord was centered in the rear or a bit longer, this wouldn't be much of an issue as I want to avoid Stretching the Cord., - Above mentioned concern about ""EMI""., - The ads state that the unused area ""remains cool"" and that is not a completely accurate statement.  One can't banish physics, and there isn't a vacuum (or a force field) to keep the heat contained inside the 6 3/4"" inner ring.  Heat will radiate out from the center to the unused area.  Not much, but it is noticeable.  Ex:  I was using a pot with a ""contact area"" of about 5 1/2"" to boil water.  When I started, the digital thermometer said the overall surface temp was about 72 degrees.  When I took the pot off the PIC Flex later, then ""center"" area was around 170 degrees and the outer ring was 84 degrees.  Obviously the heat will radiate outward from the center, with the points closest to the pot/pan being the hottest.  Since humans operate at 98.6 degrees, 84 degrees is nothing to worry about, but just mentioning that heat will radiate out from the center.  I assume the bigger the pot/pan, the hotter the temp, and the longer the time, the hotter the outside area will be.  Ex: Place a HOT pot/pan on a table, and the surface of the table is going to heat up.. etc.  UPDATE:  When I was cooking soup, the area of the ring behind the pot was pushing 115 degrees.  No force fields, so the heat is going to radiate out from the center., - If one is going to use this with an ""off"" switch, do NOT turn it ""off"" immediately after use.  The internal fan will be running for at least a minute after you stop using the PIX Flex, so wait at least 90 seconds to allow the fan to dissipate heat from the unit., - The heat has to go SOMEWHERE (physics again).  The exhaust vent doubles as a mini space heater.  I was measuring temps of 115 degrees coming out the vent, but obviously if the surface of the unit is pushing 360 degrees, the waste heat has to go somewhere.  Ex: My Dyson Slim vacuum cleaner has excellent power/suction, but the cost is the heat it puts out the exhaust vent while operating., Minor annoyances aside, this was a GREAT purchase.  I currently live in a Gas Stove World, but am eventually moving to an Electric Stove World.  The PIC Flex will be excellent for trying out new cookware as I get ready for the transition from Anodized to Stainless Steel.  It also never hurts to have an extra - portable - burner on hand and would serve as an excellent backup in case something happens to the main stove.  This would work great during a kitchen remodel or even something more mundane like ""waiting for the kitchen floor to dry"".  Grill lovers in confined spacers could get the grill add-on (32023) and have fun.","{'feature': 'safety features of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Although it maxes out at 1300 watts, I am on the Paranoid Side so will be running it at 900 watts.

I looked at a lot of options that were cheaper but the reviews were too hit or miss to make me comfortable, so instead I spent a few hundred extra to go with this option and Im very glad. Here is an in-depth review from a first time induction user:"", ""I remodeled my kitchen and was really opposed to keeping my electric cooktop; I just didnt like it. I didnt have much room in the budget to pay someone to run gas lines so I did some research and was drawn to several features of induction; namely, the speed with which it boils water/liquids and the energy efficiency (no wasted heat like you get with gas). Secondarily, I liked that the burners dont get super hot. Scraping burned-on food off of the electric cooktop was one of my least favorite tasks ever."", I did stop by a kitchen showroom to look at the induction options and luckily they had several models that I could demo and they also had pans of water to try out the boil function. When I saw for mine own eyes water that boiled in less than a minute, I was hooked. The cooktops I saw were 3-4 times as expensive as this option. I do not regret for a single moment not paying the extra money. I also do not believe that the difference in functionality reflects the difference in cost; this model does not work exponentially worse nor did the expensive ones work exponentially better. This cooktop is a great value., ""First Ill address the noise that some have complained about. Yes, from time to time, the cooktop can be noisy. Sometimes a fan comes on, other times you can hear buzzing, particularly when using power boil, and very seldom I have heard some screeching but it is usually remedied by going up or down a power level or even just simply adjusting the pot on the burner (I noticed all of these things with the $2000 models in the showroom as well). Generally speaking, the noise is no louder than the sound of the food thats cooking. Sure, an electric range will not make the same amount of noise but electric ranges dont cook nearly as well. Gas ranges also make noise. So does basically every other appliance in your kitchen when you use it."", ""I find the layout of the burners to be very smart. The large center burner is big enough to fit my cast iron dutch oven which I cook with regularly but I can also use smaller pots on it, as the burner will adjust to only heat the area that it is in contact with. Thats the beauty of induction. With electric, if your pan is too big or small for the designated burners, thats too bad, you either have to try not to roast your fingers over the exposed parts of the burner or deal with the edges of your pan not getting directly heated."", Another great feature of induction is that the burner will not get too hot to touch. While it does get quite warm, I have touched it shortly after removing a pot and not gotten burned. This is really convenient when food spills because it will not burn onto the cooktop. I simply remove the pan, wipe things down, and put the pan back. The cooktop also conveniently pauses heating when a pan is removed and resumes automatically when it is placed back. It saves energy by automatically shutting off if no burners are on or if no pan is placed on a burner for longer than 30 seconds., ""You will have to purchase induction-compatible cookware. This was not a downside for me as Id already planned on purchasing a high end set to replace my 10 year old non-stick pots and pans that were starting to flake. If handled with care, a few high end pans and a cast iron or two will meet your needs well and last for a long time (hand wash, no dishwasher, no metal utensils)."", ""I think the only complaint I can think of at this point is that the cooktop does not respond instantaneously to touch. There is about a half-second delay between touching a button and the change occurring. This was primarily an issue as I was getting used to what heat levels to use and accidentally boiling pots over a few times (dont leave the power boil on once the water is boiling or youll have a mess, turn it down a few notches and it will continue to boil). Now that I understand how to use the cooktop properly, I can anticipate when something might boil over or splatter and turn the heat down ahead of time."", ""I hope this info was helpful. The bottom line is, this is a great option at a great price. If youre considering it, just do it. Its worth it.""","{'feature': 'safety features of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Another great feature of induction is that the burner will not get too hot to touch.

I do not regret for a single moment not paying the extra money. I also do not believe that the difference in functionality reflects the difference in cost; this model does not work exponentially worse nor did the expensive ones work exponentially better. This cooktop is a great value., ""First Ill address the noise that some have complained about. Yes, from time to time, the cooktop can be noisy. Sometimes a fan comes on, other times you can hear buzzing, particularly when using power boil, and very seldom I have heard some screeching but it is usually remedied by going up or down a power level or even just simply adjusting the pot on the burner (I noticed all of these things with the $2000 models in the showroom as well).

I simply remove the pan, wipe things down, and put the pan back. The cooktop also conveniently pauses heating when a pan is removed and resumes automatically when it is placed back.

        }",1,0.006638,8.092230081558228,https://amazon.com/dp/B08YJ6ZPFJ,"I’ve been a big fan of induction cook tops for many years now.  They’re efficient, save a lot of money, are easy to use and are very safe.  That’s just the very basic, simple ones.  This NuWave PIC Pro Chef is fully featured and simply the “Cadillac” of induction cook tops—and its price reflects its value.  I believe the PIC Pro Chef is NuWave’s top-of-the-line induction cook top., For those of you who don’t know about or understand induction cooking, it’s very simple.  Underneath the glass cook top, there are copper coils that create an oscillating magnetic field.  The magnetic field speeds up the molecules in the cookware, heating the pot or pan, etc., cooking your food.  The cook top itself does not produce any heat.  Your cookware, getting hot (like rubbing your hands together quickly) is what cooks your meal.  The cook top eventually gets hot because the hot pan or pot you’re cooking in transfers some of its heat to the cook top.  You can imagine the efficiency of this cooking method.  There are no flames to transfer most of their heat to the air, making your kitchen hot.  Even with electric-coil cook tops, most of the heat is transferred to the air.  With an induction cook top, all of the heat is created by the vessel you’re cooking in, so none of the heat goes to waste.  Because the cook top doesn’t generate any heat, it’s VERY safe.  In fact, you can cook a meal at the highest temperature with a paper towel stuck between the surface of the cooktop and the cooking vessel., You must, however, have induction-ready cookware made of, or containing, a ferrous metal such as cast iron, steel or some higher quality stainless steels.  These cooking vessels are magnetic in that they attract magnets.  When you shop for induction-ready cookware, take a refrigerator magnet with you to test if a cooking vessel attracts the magnet.  Some cookware will say “induction ready” on an attached label, or will have the squiggly line symbol on the bottom.  In reality, induction cook tops can heat any type of vessel, including glass, as long as an induction disk is placed on the cooktop.  This induction disk heats up just like induction-ready cookware does, essentially becoming a “hot plate.”  I do not recommend using induction disks because they reduce the efficiency of your induction cook top and lengthen cooking times (which, of course, negates some of the advantages of induction cooking)., Here’s what I like:  When you remove the PIC Pro Chef (PIC stands for Precision Induction Cook top) from its packaging, you’re presented with a gorgeous, sleek, rectangular, black glass appliance.  Placing it next to my Nutrichef infrared cook top, which is also a gorgeous, sleek, rectangular, black glass appliance, the two complement each other and make my kitchen look very impressive (even futuristic).  Of course, the PIC Pro Chef is portable and can be used outdoors, in dorm rooms, RVs, campers and any other inconvenient location.  It’s amazing to see how quickly an induction cook top will boil water.  I bought this new PIC Pro Chef Induction cook top to replace an older NuWave model I’ve had for many years.  The older model did not have as many features as this newer model., • Multi-stage programmable cooking lets you program it to quickly heat up a dish, then have it simmer for a number of minutes, then switch automatically to a lower heat to keep it warm until you’re ready to eat., • Timer Function to start and stop cooking automatically., • Delay Function delays cooking programs until a future start time., • Lock Function to prevent unintentional button presses., • Wattage Control Button toggles watts used between 900, 1500 and 1800 watts.  This allows you to use fewer watts to keep from blowing a fuse or breaker if another high-wattage appliance is running on the same electrical circuit.  Or, just to lower costs., • Fahrenheit to Celsius L.E.D. readout., • Easy Start.  The PIC Pro Chef is preset to start cooking automatically at medium high (375° F) for one hour when you press the Start button (just for convenience and can be cancelled any time)., • Highest and Lowest.  The NuWave PIC Pro Chef can achieve higher cooking temperature than any other induction cook top (575° F) on Max/Sear and the lowest warming temperature (100° F) on Low than any other induction cook top.  Other induction cooktops are usually in the range of 140° F to 425° F, making the PIC Pro Chef the most versatile induction cook top on the market., • Pre-programmed cooking temperatures include: Low (100° F), Medium Low (175° F), Medium (275° F), Medium High (375° F), High (425° F) and Max/Sear (575° F)., • Pressing “+” or “-” will increase or decrease temperature in 5° increments.  “+” or “-” also adjusts cooking time., • Large L.E.D. display for time and temperature., What makes the NuWave PIC Pro Chef great is its precision.  You can follow the most complicated recipes exactly because you can cook at temperatures in five degree increments rather than hazy, inexact temperatures like “Medium” or “High,” where you don’t know exactly what temperature you’re cooking at.  This means less under or over cooking for you.  In professional kitchens, every piece of cooking equipment (from deep fryers to cook tops) allow you to dial in an exact temperature.  Your frying temperature, for example, can be so precise, chicken frying in a pan can have the surface of the oil as still and smooth as glass.  This is why restaurants can fry food day after day without changing the oil.  The oil just doesn’t get brown and dirty., The only quirk I’ve been able to find with the PIC Pro Chef, is that there is no “Off” button.  There is a “Start” button, which is the equivalent of an “On” button, and a ""Pause/Clear"" button, but no “Off” button.  To turn off the PIC Pro Chef, you must unplug the appliance.  Alternatively, you might have a wall socket that can be turned on and off with a light switch.  In that case, the light switch will be your “Off” button., The NuWave PIC Pro Chef is a five star product.  It goes beyond my recommendation because it is the stuff of the future and of excellence.  Enjoy (I know you will).","{'feature': 'cookware compatibility of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'You must, however, have induction-ready cookware made of, or containing, a ferrous metal such as cast iron, steel or some higher quality stainless steels.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user has mentioned that induction-ready cookware made of, or containing, a ferrous metal such as cast iron, steel or some higher quality stainless steels is required for this induction cook top to work.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",cookware compatibility,"The user has mentioned that induction-ready cookware made of, or containing, a ferrous metal such as cast iron, steel or some higher quality stainless steels is required for this induction cook top to work.",,"Induction cook top requires induction-ready cookware made of ferrous metal like cast iron, steel or higher quality stainless steels.",314460,YES,"Induction cook top requires induction-ready cookware made of ferrous metal like cast iron, steel or higher quality stainless steels.",47,248065,2024-04-02T07:32:51.877043Z,2024-04-02T07:32:51.877094Z,6.228

So, they can say 1800W so long as it is at least 1620W WHEN AT EXACTLY 120VAC.  If you have the typical 117VAC household power, the figure would be 1580W being called 1800W!  It would have been honest for this burner to be advertised as 1700W. Even the $2K drop in units with 6"" coils claim they are 1800W. Be wary of everyone's claims!}, The temperature sensor is located underneath the insulating cooking surface and thus is relatively ineffective.  Its main purpose appears to be to prevent the area under the surface from overheating.  At best, that probe can only indirectly sense the temperature of the outside bottom of the cooking pot/pan.  It would have been nice to provide a plug in temperature probe so the temperature meant something., In the temperature mode, continuous heat is generated until the temperature sensor ""thinks"" the pot has reached the selected temperature.  The burner then goes into an on/off 9 second duty cycle.  The temperature set determines the period on and wattage having NOTHING to do with any actual temperature.  In testing this often led to the temperature continuing to rise until reaching boiling for water (212F) and smoldering almost on fire for oil (stopped at 500F)., ""Lets say you want to start at 360F and then drop it down to 210F.  In temperature mode, you set 360F and then when it enters the pulsing mode you drop it to 210F.  NO DICE....  The burner does not turn off until the cookware bottom has cooled to 210F.  Instead, it continues putting heat in.  The only difference is that the on/off duty time at 210F is less than at 360F so it will over heat as fast."", To be fair, a large ""open"" pot of water bled enough heat into air that at the lowest setting the water temperature rose to and then remained just under boiling.  I did not see what the BLED was for oil to be able to report the ""equilibrim"" temperature to prevent an oil fire.  Put a cover on that pot and there will be a higher temperature equilibrium.  Hardly what I would want to rely on when the unit ""supposively"" has a temperature control function., Undocumented is that on power on the timer is automatically set to 180 minutes.  You can override this by manually setting a lower time period.  Since there is no way to use these burners for simmering, the inability to have something cooking for more than three hours is a non-issue., Induction cooking is wonderful for rapid meal preparation especially liquid cooking; but, lousy for any slow or precision cooking.  I needed to use a drop in temperature probe to do any controlled temperature cooking.  I did find it heated my oil faster for deep fat frying, recovered the temperature faster when raw food was put in, while I still needed to play with the power levels as the temperature mode was useless., Non-liquid cooking has its pitfalls as the 4"" donut ring of heat comes through induction tops more than in gas.  Its worse when the pot is being heated or kept hot in the pulse mode when #1 or #2 of watt mode or upon reaching ??? on temperature mode.  Using butter to make a cheese sandwich on #1 burned the butter while the cheese took some time to finally melt.  Special pots/pans only help by pitifully trying to more evenly conduct the heat to the entire bottom.  Doing an omelet or pancake is more a matter of moving the pan around like doing jiffy pop popcorn on the surface scratching it all up just to keep the heat transfer donut moving around.  A full 10"" pan of hash browns resulted in a burned 4-5"" donut and raw for the outer 2 inches., A nice feature is the ability to cover the surface with a layer of newspaper (catches splatter is disposable), 100% cotton cloth (will still burn the donut), or silicon (my choice).  The pot/pan needs to be within 1.5 inches of the glass top.  Even the minor pan/pot bottom indentions being typically less than a quarter inch are a non-issue.  I went to the local 2nd hand store purchasing a silicon circular cake pan and cutting the base to give me a nice 9"" silicon pad., I am keeping both the units as they are faster and recover better for hot liquid cooking; and with an anti-scratch paper/cloth/silicon, its as fast as gas for changing temperature settings and so much safer.  The expensive induction stovetops have 3,200W 11"" (3,500-10% on 117VAC) coils making this portable unit a max = medium heat unit.  My standard electric stovetop has a 3000W large burner.  Since the traditional electric element is 40% efficient, this 1700W induction at 80% efficiency gives the same max heating.  Why would anyone want an expensive 3,000W induction unless they wanted to weld metal parts?, The DUXTOP 8200MC turns on in the useless temperature mode at mid-range while the Max Burton 6000 turns on in #5 watt range.  I wish it operated like a stove starting at #1 for both units.  Since I find only the watt range of value, I prefer the Max Burton unit.  Most electronics allow user settable defaults and some even using voice control.  The Max Burton top is larger which is misleading since on a 6"" induction coil all heat is generated in a 4-5"" donut., ""I obtained both the Secura and Max Burton 1800W (1700W) portable units since they both are probably produced by the same factory being almost identical in features, operation, and cost.  Figure the lesser quality controlled brand will fail first since some folks are reporting these units failing in only a year of really heavy use.  Seems these coils drop in efficiency over time until they wont even boil water.  The clicking buttons will fail; as a handyman, I figure I will be repairing the switches over time anyways."", My stovetop cooking now consists of a $26 (440W + 1000W) hotplate for low-temperature control like simmering, my regular electric stove (only a small and a large standard element) for dryish cooking, the portable induction cooktops for all hot liquid cooking, and a microwave.  Each technology has its best application.  I was looking at gas; but, find the induction filled that void sufficiently while being safer, easier to implement, and less costly.","{'feature': 'heating efficiency of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Induction cooking is wonderful for rapid meal preparation especially liquid cooking; but, lousy for any slow or precision cooking.

That has problems too. I was able to use full power to bring things up to temperature quickly and backed off to 65% once the skillet was hot. I found I had temperature oscillations with the power setting as well. I’m not talking about the pan getting cold when adding cold food to the pan. I mean I’m cooking along with the oil measuring 350° Fahrenheit on a Thermapen Mk4 thermometer and the temperature kept dropping down to around 240° Fahrenheit periodically then oscillate back up again without adjusting the power setting., It might be great for keeping a large stockpot simmering or boiling water for pasta but I wanted it for finer temperature control and the unit I received does not do that.","{'feature': 'temperature settings of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'I try to fry foods using the 375° Fahrenheit setting and it overshoots the target temperature making the oil smoke then lets the temperature drop too low where the food barely sizzles.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user has mentioned that the electric-induction-range overshoots the target temperature while frying foods at 375° Fahrenheit, making the oil smoke and then lets the temperature drop too low where the food barely sizzles.', 'sentiment': 'negative'}",temperature settings,"The user has mentioned that the electric-induction-range overshoots the target temperature while frying foods at 375° Fahrenheit, making the oil smoke and then lets the temperature drop too low where the food barely sizzles.",,"When frying foods at 375° Fahrenheit, the electric-induction-range overshoots the target temperature, causing the oil to smoke and the temperature to drop too low, resulting in barely sizzling food.",314413,YES,"When frying foods at 375° Fahrenheit, the electric-induction-range overshoots the target temperature, causing the oil to smoke and the temperature to drop too low, resulting in barely sizzling food.",47,247889,2024-04-02T07:24:02.174872Z,2024-04-02T07:24:02.174924Z,2.343

It is so much faster easier, and more efficient to cook with induction heat.  A couple of years ago we had a fire in our attic which damaged some of our wiring.  It took almost a year to get an electrician out, and during that time we could not use our stove.  I would have been lost if I did not have an induction cooktop.  The Duxtop is much like our other cooktop, except that one has 2 burners.  It is why I rated the Duxtop 4 stars, though I would rate it 4.5 if I could.  The sole reason for the lower rating is that it takes up almost as much space as the double burner unit and is heavier, which makes it less portable., My daughter is a chef, and there are many time  when an extra burner comes in handy, especially when cooking for a crowd.  I have been so happy with my induction cooktop I was thinking about getting her one, and then she moved back home, so she has access to it if she needs one.  These are great for catering or parties, or on Thanksgiving when we are trying to make a lot of dishes at once., Having used one as my primary cooktop for a year, I think I am going to get an induction cooktop when we move, even if it mean renovating.  I was actually sorry to go back to my stove, even though it is a nice one, when we got our electric wiring repaired.  Induction cooking is just faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because you can control the temperature accurately., If you need a single burner, this is very good, and if it is an auxiliary to a regular cooktop, probably all most people will need, unless, like me, you decide you prefer induction cooking.","{'feature': 'heating efficiency of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Induction cooking is just faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because you can control the temperature accurately', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user has mentioned that induction cooking is faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because you can control the temperature accurately.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",heating efficiency,"The user has mentioned that induction cooking is faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because you can control the temperature accurately.",,"Induction cooking is faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because I can control the temperature accurately.",314403,YES,"Induction cooking is faster, safer, more efficient, and precise because I can control the temperature accurately.",47,247842,2024-04-02T07:21:24.750602Z,2024-04-02T07:21:24.750654Z,4.73

Well, that needs to be updated to ""Now you're cooking with induction!"", Seriously, I have been eyeing this particular Duxtop model for some time, and induction countertop burners in general for some number of years.  I've looked at them in person and online, and finally decided to purchase this Duxtop commercial model.  I have had it now for a little over a week, and I find myself using it daily, and even going out of my way to use it over my ""high performance"" GE Profile Dual Fuel Range.  My range has a gas cooktop that has been good, but I have always wanted to try induction.  This Duxtop commercial model outperforms even my high output burner on my range.  Boiling water is a snap, whether for a pot of coffee, or a big pot of pasta; melting butter, or clarifying butter, frying and sautéeing, cooking slowly, keeping food warm, this Duxtop is simply a dream come true., The unit itself is very well built.  The cabinet is stainless steel, the cooktop itself is thick black glass, and the touch controls are sensitive and responsive.  There are quick-start buttons, and three quick keystrokes get you cooking in a jiffy.  You can select between ""power levels"" 0.5 (Very Low) to 10 (High), and you can alternately shift to temperature mode.  Temperature mode seems to be pretty accurate; I have set the temperatures to varying levels for different foods to hold at 140°, 180°,  200°,, and each time, I fitted the pot with two separate probe thermometers on opposite sides of the pan.  In each case, I used either water, or a dense vegetable soup with chickpeas.  In all cases, the Duxtop warmed the contents of the pan evenly, and held the contents at the preset temperatures, with a little variation of about ten degrees on either side, as the burner cycled on and off.  I found this variation to be totally acceptable, and my next step will be to attempt deep frying.  I have used this for pressure cooking dried legumes, regular boiling for pastas, soups, coffee, tea, etc., simmering and slow-cooking soups, sautéeing, and shallow frying... all results have really been to absolute perfection., ""Cookware to be used with an induction cooktop must be made of ferrous metal, e.g. iron, cast iron (Lodge, Wagner, Le Creuset, Staub, etc.), stainless steel to which a magnet will stick (many brands such as All-Clad, Cuisinart, Viking).  It will NOT work with cookware made from ceramic, Pyrex, Corningware, aluminum, copper.  The best way to test your cookware is to take a standard kitchen magnet, and test the bottoms of your cookware.  If the magnet sticks, youre good to go; if not, then reserve that for your stove.  Speaking of cast iron, and this Duxtop commercial model, this particular model can withstand a total weight capacity of sixty-five (65) pounds!  This model is, as I said, well built, heavy for its size, and very, very stable on the countertop."", I shall give updates, if I find them necessary, as to continued performance and longevity, but it is my instinct that this is one of the best choices I have ever made in terms of having a good, high quality accessory burner to supplement my stove.  If I had to voice a regret, it would only be that I should not have waited this long to make this purchase.  It is well worth the money!  As a matter of fact, I am going to order another one soon.  You can buy this with confidence., MARCH 2021:  THIRTEEN MONTH IN-SERVICE UPDATE:, Performance is just as excellent thirteen months later as the first day I plugged it in and put into service.

        }",2,0.005769,8.887736082077026,https://amazon.com/dp/B07G9YKPQC,"  The Duxtop Professional Portable Induction Cooktop is exactly that: a portable one-burner cooktop that heats pans through induction, unlike radiant/electric or gas stoves. An induction cooktop means your pans must have bottoms made from ferrous materials, such as cast iron, iron, magnetic steel, and enameled iron. Cookware made from glass, ceramic, copper, aluminum, or non-magnetic stainless steel cannot be used. The dimensions are 12.9 x 16.5 x 4 inches and weighs about 13 pounds., The cooktop surface is glass marked with rings to help you align your pan properly. The control panel has touch controls for power, menu, +/-, keep warm, boil, timer, lock, and a backlit LCD display. The menu button allows you to select one of two modes: Power or Temperature. In Power Mode, 20 power levels range from 100W to 1800W, while in Temperature Mode 20 temperature levels can be set from 100F to 460F. The Lock button locks the other controls (except power), for example, so you don’t accidentally reset the timer. The boil button turns the unit to Power Mode level 10 and sets the timer for 10 minutes. The keep warm button switches to Temperature Mode at 140F for 30 minutes. The timer can be set up to 10 hours., In use this cooktop was a great addition to my kitchen workflow. I cook a lot of pasta, which means I often need to boil large pots of water. My kitchen has a gas stove, but I can put this induction cooktop on my counter and boil the water much more quickly than on my stove. That is my main use, but it is also useful for example for cooking things where I want something to cook without boiling–the Temperature Mode is used for this., There are two drawbacks though. First, the unit is very noisy. There is a powerful 7-blade fan that vents warm air out of the back of the unit to keep the electronics from overheating–this fan is quite loud. Second, the beeps made by the unit are also very loud. Anytime you press a button or if there is an error, or if the timer is finished the unit beeps. Also, if you turn the cooktop on without a proper pan already on the unit the unit will flash an error message and continuously beep. So, just keep in mind that the fan and beeps are very noisy/loud., All in all the Duxtop Professional Portable Induction Cooktop gives me an efficient way to cook. I also like that it cleans easily and is built like a tank–the cooktop can support up to 65 pounds. Finally, because the cooktop cooks by induction, the unit is safer, as it can’t heat up the surface unless a pan is on it, and the glass only retains residual heat from the pan once you are through cooking–the display even shows a “Hot” message to indicate the glass is still hot. I think this cooktop would especially be useful for cooking in an RV or in a garage/workshop/porch/deck because of its induction cooking and portability, as long as you have a 120V/15A power connection., Thanks for reading.

        }",5,0.005668,7.188465356826782,https://amazon.com/dp/B00GMCAM2G,"  This little induction cooktop does everything it needs to do very well on a countertop.  If you want to cook your food without heating the entire room then this is the counter '' table top cooking unit for you.  Remember that this is an induction cooktop which means it heats the pan by exciting the atoms in magnetic pans.  If a pan does not have a strong attraction for a magnet you can not use the cookware on any induction cooktop., I found it best to use a stainless steel or cast iron pan that has a very flat bottom.  If your magnetic pan has too many curves, patterns, dents, bends or decorations in its bottom the cooktop metal sensors might not auto detect the pan when it is in place on the cooktop.  Cooking with magnitism is like cooking with gas in that any change in the settings is almost immediately translated to change in heat levels the pan and food.  the minute you change the heat the inducer immediately stops aggitating the atoms and the heat drops off fairly quickly.  In an heating element stove waste heat continues to discharge long after the element has been reduced or turned off., Cooking the perfect dish is all about being able to manage the heat input into the pan and the food contained therein.  Magnetic induction cooking allows for the most percise cooking due to its ability to terminate heat and moderate heat in an almost instanteanous way.  Best of all Induction cooking does not polute the room with lots of waste heat as radiiant elements do.  Radiant elements raise your air conditioning bills in summer because; they heat the house along with the food.  Induction cooking heats only the pan, the room is heated only by the waste heat from the cooking process itself.  Another cool thing about induction cooking is it allows you to bring the cooking to the table if you want to show off your cooking skills.  If you want to make pancakes right at the table this will let you do just that.  I have a flat cast iron pancake griddle and I can make pancakes right at the table with this WOW how awesome., ""The settings and controls on this DUXTOP unit are clear and easy to understand.  Another cool thing is the numbers light up they are NOT LCD numbers that are often harder to read when you get older.  This unit is better for old people because; unlike radiant heat burners these magnetic stoves dont get as hot.  Yes the pan is hot but their is not the danger posed by waste radiant heat.  Another safety system is the DUXTOP magnetic cook top turns itself off when the magnetic pot, griddle or pan is removed from its surface.  No more fires from leaving a radiant cooking source in the on position.  If an elderly person takes the cooking vessel off the magnetic cooktop all energy shuts down and the surface becomes cool to the ytouch much sooner than any radiant heat cooking source.  This Magnetic induction cooking technology is awesome for so many reasons and I just shared a few here."", This DUXTOP unit is awesome.  I have had no trouble with it heating up and doing everything I need.  The only negative is the heat only goes to 450F and I would have liked 500F.  I like making candy apples for the kids.  I need a really hot pan to make candy apples.  It is a small inconvenience but I note it in fairness and accuracy.

        }",1,0.0072825,9.664228916168211,https://amazon.com/dp/B00GMCAM2G,"""  I was very skeptical about getting an induction cooktop. Ive seen some real bad reviews on many units , and I was concerned about the diameter of the heating area against the bottom of the pans.  Ive seen videos in my research on some of the induction tops and many of them looked as though the heating circle was only about 4 inches in the center because thats where the water was boiling, and I thought ,  if I put a skillet on it,  Ill have to keep moving the food over the center,  as the center is going to be the hot area and the outer portion of the pans are not going to get as much heat."", ""Well, I searched and searched and came across this Duxtop  9100C  model at a reasonable price and thought I would give it a try however,  it says that for induction you need pans that a magnet will stick to or you cant use them.  Well  none of my stainless cookware would hold a magnet and I have a 32 piece set.  So what I did was I researched more and came upon a nice 10 piece stainless  set made by Duxtop for this induction top and I bought them.  Boy, am I glad I did, but thats another review, if youre in need of a beautiful and very heavy triple clad set of pans check out the 10 piece set sold here on Amazon they are absolutely stunning.  The bottom of each pan it a triple clad bottom with no line showing like my older stainless cook pans have, these Duxtop pans have a beautiful smooth rounded edge leading to the bottom so you dont even know they are clad on the bottom, plus the side walls of each pan has to be about 1/8 inch thick... Im just amazed because they are so heavy, and my older set was very costly and the side walls of my stainless set are paper thin.  The handles also on the Duxtop pans are solid not hollow.  I have to say they cook so well on this Duxtop unit.  The  Duxtop unit itself is very accurate, and I put it the boil water test, and I took a  3 quart sauce pan and put is about half full of cold water they turned on the Duxtop. Well in less than  3 minutes I have a rolling boil. What I do it turn the unit on, and it defaults to a number 5 setting which is  320 degrees I believe on the dial when you press the  temp button. When you press the Temp button you can toggle between the temperature you want of a number from 1 to 15.  I also gave it the simmer test and yes it will simmer at 200 degrees, it will cycle on and off but you wont hear any changes.  The unit has a fan that you can hear but its not obnoxious or loud and it runs after you turn off the cooktop for about a minute to cool the internal parts.  Nothing gets hot other than your pan like the commecials on Tv  show about induction. The pan is hot but the cook top is not, and this is true you can put your hand right onto the glass cooktop right up to the pan you are cooking in and it is cool not even warm.  I am very impressed with this unit, and it move in 20 degree increments when its in Temp mode, you can go  140,  160,  180, 200, etc all the way to 460 but I have found that I never have had to go beyond  320. Water will boil if you set it on 220 vigously so why set it higher and use more electricity?  The unit begins at the bottom end using only 200 watts on the 140 degree setting, and it climbs up from there all the way to 1800 watts if you have it on 460 degrees.  Personally I cant see having to set it very high because even frying eggs or burgers, or pork chops etc,  I leave it about  320 and then I lower it down to about 200 to keep them hot. Nice thing is you can drop it to 140 and your food will stay nice and toasty.  I cant do that on my Gas stove.  I also cant boil a pot of water in 3 minutes, and with my gas stove there is always heat coming up around the sides of the pans, which make the handles super hot and I need pot holders a lot of the time. On the Duxtop youll have cool handles and I really mean cool.  I really like this Duxtop cooktop, so I purchased a second one and I plan on putting them side by side on the kitchen counter , but  Im going to install a separate  20 amp  line for the second unit, as you cant run 2 of these on the same electric line or you will pop the breaker.  Cleanup is very simple as the top is a tempered glass and very nice done up in black.  Also what I was going to say is that the circle of magnetic force is larger on this Duxtop 9100MC.  I would say its 6 inches or better because when I put the 3 quart sauce pan on and boil water I can see the diameter of the bubbles and they pretty well cover the entire bottom of the pan.  There are no humming sounds as I have read from some reviews,  and I believe a humming or growling sound is due to the cookware being used.  If you raise the pan off the surface the unit will display Error ,a and it will stop cooking but it resumes if you put the pan back on it .  The unit is very light and you can take it anywhere.  Ive taken mine out on my back deck on a wood folding table and did some cooking outside with it .  Also from the time I got the Duxtop units  Ive rarely used my gas stove, I prefer to use the Duxtop induction top to cook on.  I can do fried eggs in minutes and not burn them and they dont stick.  I make a grilled cheese sandwich in a couple of minutes and the bread comes out very nice with a golden tan and again no scorching, unless you set the temperature too high and dont flip it regularly.  The cooktop is a 5 star unit in my book, I use it daily and out of all the units I reviewed this one is a Winner, you cant go wrong for the price and features. Its very safe,  if you have a child you wont worry about them burning their hands unless they grab the pan itself, and when you turn the cooktop off, its instant off and the glass is just warm under the pan area and cools down rapidly.  I like it a lot, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking they might want to try induction cooking. It really does get the job done and its very safe,  I leave the wooden spoon on the skillet at times and I have no worry that the flames will toast the wooden spoon which is what happens on gas stoves.  Try it out, you can always send it back if youre not happy but Im sure you will love it as I do mine....Also lots of safety features such as auto shut down, if you forget its on ,  2 hours it will shut down and you wont blow up your eggs.  If youre elderly and fall asleep when you put your tea water on you wont have to worry about the pan being red hot if your water evaporates it has a temperature sensor that will turn it off if tis goes to high so the safety features alone are well worth the peace of mind. I used to always worry about my mother  who was in her 80sand she often forgot the pan on her stove,  she lived alone after my father passed away and I was always worried that she might set her kitchen on fire,  but not with a Duxtop induction unit,  I would have had peace of mind.... These units are awesome....""","{'feature': 'safety features of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Also lots of safety features such as auto shut down, if you forget its on ,  2 hours it will shut down and you wont blow up your eggs.

A friend had demonstrated their built-in induction cooktop to us; we had been impressed with a pot of water coming to boil in about two minutes, and the fact that immediately after a burner was turned off, a person could place their hand on the burner itself and and it was not hot.  So, based on the positive reviews we had read on the Amazon site, we ordered the 9100MC., We received our Duxtop countertop cooktop yesterday and, having read the instruction manual thoroughly, decided to test it by boiling 6 cups of cool water in a stainless steel pot that we had also tested would hold a magnet per the instruction manual. SEVENTEEN minutes later the water began to boil.  We were also surprised that right on the unit it said the surface would remain hot.  It did remain hot, for an additional TEN minutes., We then conducted a test for bringing water to a full boil between 1) a Russell Hobbs 1500 Watt electric tea kettle, 2) a different Le Creuset pot on the induction cooktop, and 3) a stainless pot on the JennAir stovetop. Each contained the identical amount of equallly cold water (6 cups)., The results were:, First place: the Russell Hobbs tea kettle at 6 minutes., Second place: the induction cooktop and Le Creuset pot at 10 minutes., The JennAir stovetop at 19 minutes., To our surprise, the surface of the Duxtop remained hot for an additional 17 minutes.  We also noticed that it was quite noisy (fan and other noise) when running., ""This Duxtop unit did not come anywhere near what we had expected, based on reviews.  But, since nobody else seems to have complained about how long it takes the Duxtop to boil water, we have to assume that we must have received a defective device.  We are willing to give Duxtop another chance, and have used Amazons easy return service to try another unit.  Well see how the next one works, and then write another review."", It hardly seems worth the cost of this 1800 watt induction unit to save only 9 minutes of time over the JennAir.  And for it to be occupying space on a countertop and remaining hot is a problem.  It also has a footprint three times the size of our tea kettle., Since we have a kettle that is out performing the induction cooktop, we returned the unit.  Granted we do not cook food in our tea kettle, but so much of what we do (canning, blanching, cooking pasta or rice) is about bringing water to a boil.  We can simply heat the water in our kettle and put in a pot on the JennAir to remain boiling., Update November 2:  We just got our replacement Duxtop from Amazon yesterday.  It is definitely superior to the original one we got.  We conducted the same test - boiling six cups of cold water in a LeCreuset cast iron 8 inch diameter pot.  This unit took 8 minutes to get the water to a rolling boil.  After removing the pot, its fan continued to run for 1.5 minutes, and its ""Hot"" message remained on for 8 to 10 minutes after removing the pot., ""We had hoped to reach a boil in under 4 minutes, based on other reports we had read.  We are also surprised at how long the unit remained too hot to touch.  We will be keeping this unit, but are now aware of its shortcomings.  Its rating should probably go from one star to three stars.  We highly recommend that the unit be tested when its first received, just to make sure that its working OK.

        }",2,0.00781,7.447996854782104,https://amazon.com/dp/B00GMCAM2G,"""  After careful research and a few experiments with other folks induction cooktops (NuWave, Max Burton & Tramontina), I chose the Secura DUXTOP 9100MC and havent regretted it. While the NuWave claims to have more temperature and power settings, it seemed to me that there was more frequent power cycling at comparable temp/power levels than the 9100MC. Saying nothing bad about Max Burton and Tramontina, I eliminated them for not having as many power and temperature target settings as the 15 levels (each) available on the 9100MC."", In order to maintain temperature control, in temperature mode operation, induction cookers have to cycle on and off in order to ""hover"" around any target temperature. One difference between lesser & better induction cooktops is how much power (actual Watts) is being cycled for any given temperature target. 5 seconds of 1800 Watts/pulse is going to be more energy violent (to whatever is being heated) than 30 seconds of 300 Watts/pulse, even though these two pulses represent the same amount of total power., ""The 9100MC uses a wider range of Watts/pulse across the range of supported temperature targets than other induction cooktops, so cooking should be gentler across the lower temperature targets. theres a table in the printed manual breaking this all out."", In power level mode, I did not notice much power cycling above power level 2.5 (=500W) per power setting, indicating that the 9100MC is providing a more even/continuous flow of power to the induction coils, at each power setting, rather than pulsing fewer fixed power flows across a range of given power settings. I did not test this with an ammeter, but rather by using an IR temperature gun, aimed inside the cookware in use, and observing how water heats at different power levels., The type and quality of induction cookware is going to make a big difference in how any induction cooktop is going to perform. Aside from the magnet test, pure steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, such that cheap steel pans are going to experience high initial temperature overshoots, in target temperature mode, and actual ring shaped hotspots on the cooking surface side over the course of any prolonged cooking, whether by power level or target temperature., ""The initial target temperature overshoots occur inside the cookware because the cooktops temperature sensor is beneath the cooktops glass surface and NOT inside the actual cookware. There is always going to be a time lag before the heat, reflecting back from the bottom of the cookware, registers with the cooktops temperature sensor. It is during that initial temp sensor time lag that temperature overshoots can happen INSIDE the cookware (sometimes momentarily exceeding 500F, depending on the pot/pan). Any induction cookware that exhibits ringed hotspots while cooking is going to be VERY PROBLEMATIC for target temperature cooking on ANY induction cooktop, not just the 9100MC."", Cast iron cookware can tend to even out the ringed hotspot effect seen with cheap pure steel cookware, but cast iron is generally on the heavy side and can present other cooking issues., What I've chosen to begin collecting for induction cooking is fully bonded, ""tri-clad,"" 18-0 stainless steel (exterior)/full-core 3004 aluminum/18-8 stainless steel(interior) cookware. The 18-0 steel exterior is the induction layer, delivering heat directly to the aluminum core. The 3004 aluminum core rapidly distributes the heat all across the bottom and sides of the cookware, eliminating the ringed hotspot problem. The 18-8 stainless steel interior provides the non-chemically reactive cooking surface. I've really come to admire Vollrath's Tribute line of pots and pans as a result. These Vollrath post/pans have completely flat bottoms, which is also a huge plus for induction cooking. High quality, tri-clad cookware, with excellent heat distribution across the entire cook surface, is a must for accurate, target-temperature-based cooking., Even slightly warped induction cookware, no matter what its composition, is going to produce very uneven heating/cooking performance (which you may or may not want)., ""Partially or non-fully bonded tri-clad cookware can vibrate, between the metal layers, at certain power/temp settings, producing a high pitched whine that may or may not annoy you during cooking. Thats because the different metal layers are vibrating against one another, as a direct consequence of the induction process, and ANY air gaps/hollows between layers can then generate audible noise, which will vary from pan to pan. Generally speaking, the higher the power level, the more vibration and the greater chance that there will be a high-pitched whine."", I will never use any external steel heat diffusers in an attempt to ""adapt"" non-magnetic cookware for induction cooking. First, an all-steel diffuser is guaranteed to create ringed hotspots, because steel is a poor conductor of heat, making target temp cooking very problematic. Any induction diffuser essentially turns the highly power efficient induction cooktop, back into a far less efficient, radiant heat hotplate. If I wanted to cook on a hot plate, I would've used a hot plate to begin with. Induction diffusers make no sense to me, but you can always find someone who'll sell one to you., ""I also took the following dB sound measurements, 3 from the front of each appliance while running:"", DUXTOP 9100MC = 46-48dB, Panasonic 1100W microwave oven = 48-55dB, Kenmore refrigerator = 40-43dB, ambient kitchen = 7-13dB (from the center of kitchen, with no motors running), So, the 9100MC is louder than the fridge, but quieter than the microwave. Subjectively, the 9100MC is not too noisy for me. but your own dB readings may vary (depending on the physical condition of your cooling fan/appliances) and everyone is entitled to their sonic preferences., I like the fact that the 9100MC gives audible and visual cues that it is energized and/or cooking. Total silence in operation would be an unwelcomed and dangerous way to go., When not in use, I completely unplug the 9100MC from AC power. When the 9100MC is in use, I make sure that no other appliances on the same circuit (not just the same plug) are ever in concurrent use, 1800W is 1800W., One thing that surprised me when using my older cookware from gas cooking days, on the 9100MC, was the amount of white, waxy build-up that would suddenly appear on the 9100MC's glass cooktop. It turns out that thin oil residue/skin, that builds up over time from radiant heat cooking, on the outside/bottom of cookware (no matter how ""clean"" it may look to the eye), gets literally boiled off of the cookware, by induction heating, depositing a cloudy ""wax"" on the cooktop's glass. In order to remove this waxy boil-off and restore the original beauty of the 9100MC cooktop, I used a fish-oil based, light machine oil, as a solvent, a microfiber cloth and the requisite elbow grease., ""Even though the printed manual says not to place the 9100MC on top of any steel surface, Ive found that there are no EM/RF heating effects below the 9100MC when the unit is sitting directly on top of a steel cooking cart or on top of a steel wire rack."", The angled control panel is a big plus. There is no way for a pot/pan to damage the panel from direct ""hot"" contact while on the cooktop surface. I also have faith that the plastic-film covered blister-style control buttons are durable enough for my needs and actually prefer them over ""touch"" sensor controls. I want the tactile sense that a button has been pressed., The two things most likely to fail, IMO, are the induction coil cooling fan and the glass cooktop. While I have no intention of abusing my 9100MC, I have no idea what kind of bearing system the fan uses (ball bearings=best, sleeve bearing=worst). The printed manual also says the unit cannot support more than 25lbs total load. So, I bit the bullet and purchased a multi-year asurion/Canopy protection policy, as either of these failures would be total showstoppers., ""The only modification that I made to the 9100MC is to add an air intake filter to the exterior of the case opening for the induction coil cooling fan. I did this to reduce the odds that lint/dust/oil vapor will be sucked inside the case by the fan, without impeding airflow. The filter is made from soft screen material designed for use with overhead cooking exhaust fans and is held in place by a frame of painters tape."", Induction cooking has it's own learning curve. I'm finding that power-level cooking is more useful and successful than target temperature cooking for dynamic, hands on cooking. I never start a ""cold"" pan in target temperature mode, in order to reduce the risk of initial temperature overshoots. I use an IR temp gun to learn how different pots/pans perform on the induction cooktop. I find the 9100MC's wider variety of power and target temp settings, in the low and medium ranges, are very useful and sufficiently granular for my cooking needs -- along with understanding how my different pots/pans actually perform., I have no need for the 9100MC to have a 212F target temp setting. I live at sea level. If I want 212F, then I cook in boiling water or with atmospheric steam and let the water/steam control 212F. Or, I will use a convection oven set to 212F. I do want very even heating/energy delivery at whatever setting I pick and the 9100MC delivers that in spades. Induction cooking, once mastered, makes it very difficult to accidentally burn food, and opens up slower/lower-temp dynamic/interactive cooking as a whole new world to explore., ""As far as Lafraise is concerned, I have no complaints. I will say that Amazon shipping did not do a first class job of packaging the retail 9100MC box for shipping. The Amazon box was holed in transit and there was inadequate padding inside the Amazon box, such that the retail packaging suffered a minor puncture. My 9100MC arrived undamaged and fully functional, but Amazon needs to do a better job to protect Lafraises good reputation in the Marketplace by shipping more promptly, with better protective packaging.""","{'feature': 'cookware compatibility of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The type and quality of induction cookware is going to make a big difference in how any induction cooktop is going to perform.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The reviewer emphasizes the importance of using the right type and quality of induction cookware for optimal performance of the induction cooktop.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",cookware compatibility,The reviewer emphasizes the importance of using the right type and quality of induction cookware for optimal performance of the induction cooktop.,,I emphasize the importance of using the right type and quality of induction cookware for optimal performance of the induction cooktop.,314346,YES,I emphasize the importance of using the right type and quality of induction cookware for optimal performance of the induction cooktop.,47,247696,2024-04-02T07:06:08.817410Z,2024-04-02T07:06:08.817487Z,21.617

It's a cheap induction that functions really well. It's a bit smaller than typical electric cooktop untis so if you have granite and your switching to this be prepared to do some upgrades. What I did was install 1/4"" flat stock steel plates on 2 sides of my existing opening and held them in place with 4400 psi epoxy., ""After that the unit fit in perfectly and I caulked it in place to make sure it was snug and didnt move. They tell you to not caulk the unit as it needs to be removalable for service but I guess they dont know what a razor is and how easily it can be removed."", It takes 10 minutes to boil 1 gallon of water in a large stock pot. Each coil is exactly the same size regardless of what burner you use which is a bit frustrating. The only difference between the burners is amount of power that can be allocated to each., Cast iron is your friend in this instance and if you want to have the entire surface of a 12"" cast iron pan hot you'll need to use boost for a few minutes then lower the temp to allow the heat to disperse to the entire pan., This is not normal.. I have a high end bertazzoni and each coil is designed for the specific burner. Once again you get what you pay for., ""Im not sure if this is normal but our unit has a slight hot electronics smell when cooking. Maybe this is because its been installed less than 24 hours but its enough to be slightly alarming. I have a full open cabinet beneath and tons of ventilation so I know its nothing to do with that."", If this is your first induction range be prepared for a learning curve and a small investment of higher end cookware. The following work really well.., Cast iron, All-clad, Carbon steel, The following suck, Cheaply made metal alloys., ""The following wont work"", Aluminum, Glass cookware, ""Youll save a bit on power but not how you think.. induction units use the same wattage as traditional electric ranges but it takes a lot less time to heat up. Which is another thing.. your cooking habits will change. No more start the pan and then start chopping up whatever your cooking. Now youll prep before turning the pan on.. hence the 20% of power savings most induction ranges claim."", Be ready for the noise. Most inductions (my bertazzoni excluded) make a hum/hiss noise when cooking. This is from the reaction of the metal cookware itself. Some higher end ranges have figured out how to minimize this but this range makes no attempt to.

I chose the Hamilton Beach 34104 mainly for the benefit of a having a US-based company to call in case I had quality issues.  We purchased this induction cooktop for our first vacation during the pandemic, staying in a remote lodge and not wanting to be limited with our options for meals.  We set up it up in our room to reheat pre-made meals or to make breakfast burritos and hot sandwiches.  Upon initial use, the control was not quite intuitive (especially since we left the manual at home).  There are power settings ranging from 1-10 and temperature settings starting at 175deg F.  Like any induction cooktop, it takes a while to figure out the settings that suit the cooking scenario.  Its also important to note that the cookware needs to be ferrous, which you can check with the magnet.  Once we got the hang of the cooking settings we were pleased with the convenience of having cooking abilities on-the-go.

After reading the information before buying about the limitations of using this two-burner unit with the maximum allotted 1800 amps split between the burners, I was a little bit worried if there would be enough heat. I was also worried that using just one of the dual burners on this unit might be less powerful than my old single-burner Duxtop.

That is not how these work. The temperature setting is referencing the temperature the induction coil will produce. It is the equivalent to setting your gas stove flame to low, medium or high. It does not control the temperature of your pot, it just determines how much heat is applied to the pot. This will determine how quickly your pot will reach maximum temperature. This is not a thermostatic device, it merely sets the temp of the coil. The higher the temperature setting the faster your pot will get hot. Simple as that. If you want to control the cooking temperature I would suggest you use a sous vide pot, with which you can control the temperature of the cooking water to within 1 degree., ""2) People seem to think the cooking plate surface should not be hot because there is no flame. It is accurate that the cooking surface will not get hot when turned on - if the device is turned on and there is no pot or pan on the surface the cooking surface will stay cool. However, once you boil your water or cook your sauce, dont forget you have a ten pound pot filled with food sitting on the cooking surface, and the pot or pan is likely over 200 degrees. So if you put a hot pot on ANY surface, the hot pot will make that surface hot, too. People in other reviews complained they burned their fingers because they put their hands on the cooking surface after removing a boiling pot assuming the cooking surface would still be cool. How a surface would stay cool with a boiling pot of water on it beats me, but these people deserve the Darwin award for not thinking this through. The cooking surface DOES get hot, but from the hot pot, not from the cooking elements."", Good luck out there.","{'feature': 'temperature settings of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Many people assume the temperature settings on this (and other) induction cook tops refers to the temperature of the contents of your pot, for instance, if you set the temp to 180 people think the contents of the pot will be 180 degrees.

I’ve heard about it a lot but never actually tried one until now. This one is my first induction cooker. On first use when it boiled water within 1 minutes I was just shocked how efficient this technology is., Coming to product itself I was impressed how well this product was packaged. I have found many seller compromising packaging just to lower some weight making actual product vulnerable to breakage. This one is inside two boxes directly from manufacturer. Inside it is well wrapped in safety cases and plastics. There was not a single scratch or any complain on the aesthetic view. Kudos to packaging., The provided manual is all I needed to get started. It was actually easy. Just plugin and have a pan/dish to cooking area and press power button and press watt/temp button which will start it. We have to be careful with induction technology that we shouldn’t keep empty pan on cooking area for long time without any content on it . If there is no pan on cooking area then it won’t turn on at all. It will give a single indicating it can’t start. Controller is touch sensitive and it have lock button to prevent accidental touched to controller. I can control the power of each burner individually. The maximum wattage of this unit it 1800 Watt. If I use only one burner I can go upto 1800 watt in single one. With two burner on I have it one at 800 and other at 1000. The controller is really responsive. As soon as I press the button I can see instant effect on my food. May be this is more of induction rather than product ifself. The LED display is clear and informative., For cleaning it is so much easy. Top part is glass I think which is usual case for all induction cooker and is so for this one as well. I press the lock button and do the cleaning with wet towels and it works perfectly. Overall impressed with this product and the efficiency of induction technology.","{'feature': 'safety features of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Controller is touch sensitive and it have lock button to prevent accidental touched to controller', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The reviewer appreciates the safety features, specifically the touch-sensitive controller with a lock button to prevent accidental touches.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",safety features,"The reviewer appreciates the safety features, specifically the touch-sensitive controller with a lock button to prevent accidental touches.",,"I appreciate the safety features, especially the touch-sensitive controller with a lock button to prevent accidental touches.",314075,NO,"I appreciate the safety features, especially the touch-sensitive controller with a lock button to prevent accidental touches.",47,245889,2024-04-02T04:19:27.072160Z,2024-04-02T04:19:27.072208Z,118.874

I’ve heard about it a lot but never actually tried one until now. This one is my first induction cooker. On first use when it boiled water within 1 minutes I was just shocked how efficient this technology is., Coming to product itself I was impressed how well this product was packaged. I have found many seller compromising packaging just to lower some weight making actual product vulnerable to breakage. This one is inside two boxes directly from manufacturer. Inside it is well wrapped in safety cases and plastics. There was not a single scratch or any complain on the aesthetic view. Kudos to packaging., The provided manual is all I needed to get started. It was actually easy. Just plugin and have a pan/dish to cooking area and press power button and press watt/temp button which will start it. We have to be careful with induction technology that we shouldn’t keep empty pan on cooking area for long time without any content on it . If there is no pan on cooking area then it won’t turn on at all. It will give a single indicating it can’t start. Controller is touch sensitive and it have lock button to prevent accidental touched to controller. I can control the power of each burner individually. The maximum wattage of this unit it 1800 Watt. If I use only one burner I can go upto 1800 watt in single one. With two burner on I have it one at 800 and other at 1000. The controller is really responsive. As soon as I press the button I can see instant effect on my food. May be this is more of induction rather than product ifself. The LED display is clear and informative., For cleaning it is so much easy. Top part is glass I think which is usual case for all induction cooker and is so for this one as well. I press the lock button and do the cleaning with wet towels and it works perfectly. Overall impressed with this product and the efficiency of induction technology.","{'feature': 'heating efficiency of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'On first use when it boiled water within 1 minutes I was just shocked how efficient this technology is', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user was impressed with the heating efficiency of the electric-induction-range when it boiled water within 1 minute on first use.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",heating efficiency,The user was impressed with the heating efficiency of the electric-induction-range when it boiled water within 1 minute on first use.,,I was impressed with the heating efficiency of the electric-induction-range as it boiled water within 1 minute on first use.,314072,YES,I was impressed with the heating efficiency of the electric-induction-range as it boiled water within 1 minute on first use.,47,245866,2024-04-02T04:13:01.228776Z,2024-04-02T04:13:01.228826Z,60.714

I’ve heard about it a lot but never actually tried one until now. This one is my first induction cooker. On first use when it boiled water within 1 minutes I was just shocked how efficient this technology is., Coming to product itself I was impressed how well this product was packaged. I have found many seller compromising packaging just to lower some weight making actual product vulnerable to breakage. This one is inside two boxes directly from manufacturer. Inside it is well wrapped in safety cases and plastics. There was not a single scratch or any complain on the aesthetic view. Kudos to packaging., The provided manual is all I needed to get started. It was actually easy. Just plugin and have a pan/dish to cooking area and press power button and press watt/temp button which will start it. We have to be careful with induction technology that we shouldn’t keep empty pan on cooking area for long time without any content on it . If there is no pan on cooking area then it won’t turn on at all. It will give a single indicating it can’t start. Controller is touch sensitive and it have lock button to prevent accidental touched to controller. I can control the power of each burner individually. The maximum wattage of this unit it 1800 Watt. If I use only one burner I can go upto 1800 watt in single one. With two burner on I have it one at 800 and other at 1000. The controller is really responsive. As soon as I press the button I can see instant effect on my food. May be this is more of induction rather than product ifself. The LED display is clear and informative., For cleaning it is so much easy. Top part is glass I think which is usual case for all induction cooker and is so for this one as well. I press the lock button and do the cleaning with wet towels and it works perfectly.

There are 9 power levels for both left/right hob:

200W-1800W, very easy to adjust it.

I like to fry steak and bacon, so I can choose the temperature cooking mode to avoid overcook and burning.","{'feature': 'cleaning ease of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The surface is also very easy to clean.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the surface of the electric-induction-range is very easy to clean.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",cleaning ease,The user mentioned that the surface of the electric-induction-range is very easy to clean.,,The surface of the electric-induction-range is very easy to clean.,314060,NO,The surface of the electric-induction-range is very easy to clean.,47,245827,2024-04-02T04:01:57.327452Z,2024-04-02T04:01:57.327504Z,3.23

This was my first induction cooktop, so I didnt really know what I was looking for.

The problem I have had is that the temperature increments are too large, like a 30+ degree difference.

Food can be frying too much because the pan is too hot, turn it down one step

and it will barely be sizzling.

The same with boiling/simmering.

Get something to a rolling boil, turn it down one step

and then it wont even be at a simmer.","{'feature': 'cleaning ease of electric-induction-range', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Easy to clean and operate.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the electric-induction-range is easy to clean and operate.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",cleaning ease,The user mentioned that the electric-induction-range is easy to clean and operate.,,The electric-induction-range is easy to clean and operate.,314059,NO,The electric-induction-range is easy to clean and operate.,47,245787,2024-04-02T03:55:02.561185Z,2024-04-02T03:55:02.561239Z,3.911

I’ve heard about it a lot but never actually tried one until now. This one is my first induction cooker. On first use when it boiled water within 1 minutes I was just shocked how efficient this technology is., Coming to product itself I was impressed how well this product was packaged. I have found many seller compromising packaging just to lower some weight making actual product vulnerable to breakage. This one is inside two boxes directly from manufacturer. Inside it is well wrapped in safety cases and plastics. There was not a single scratch or any complain on the aesthetic view. Kudos to packaging., The provided manual is all I needed to get started. It was actually easy. Just plugin and have a pan/dish to cooking area and press power button and press watt/temp button which will start it. We have to be careful with induction technology that we shouldn’t keep empty pan on cooking area for long time without any content on it . If there is no pan on cooking area then it won’t turn on at all. It will give a single indicating it can’t start. Controller is touch sensitive and it have lock button to prevent accidental touched to controller. I can control the power of each burner individually. The maximum wattage of this unit it 1800 Watt. If I use only one burner I can go upto 1800 watt in single one. With two burner on I have it one at 800 and other at 1000. The controller is really responsive. As soon as I press the button I can see instant effect on my food. May be this is more of induction rather than product ifself. The LED display is clear and informative., For cleaning it is so much easy. Top part is glass I think which is usual case for all induction cooker and is so for this one as well.
