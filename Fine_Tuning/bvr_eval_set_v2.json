Finally, the barrel itself is relatively easy to clean\u2014I\u2019ve already had to wash this thing and I\u2019ve had it for a grand total of 4 days\u2014except that the litter screen is screwed into the machine and cannot be removed for cleaning, which is ridiculous since you can\u2019t clean behind it, either. In sum, this is one of the most poorly engineered \u201cself-cleaning\u201d litter boxes I\u2019ve ever used. I have never had such problems with the high-performing Instachew Purrclean self-cleaning boxes, but I thought I would try one where the opening is closer to the ground, for my older cat.  Big mistake. With the Purrclean, I have to empty the dirty litter receptacle maybe once every 10 days (no, I don\u2019t work for Instachew, but due credit should be noted). In any case, I would absolutely NOT recommend that you purchase this product. For my older cat, I\u2019ll just give him the option of a regular litter box, which is infinitely easier to clean and maintain than this thing."

I got the wrist straps and they're great. my wrist straps are the camo and match the green strip knee wraps. They're very long. Pay attention to how long 72\" actually is before you buy these. I'm guessing even being smaller stature there's a reason behind the very long length. I'm trying to find an instructional video how to put these knee wraps on because first night I only tried twice and I said I probably have to spend more time, I'll figure it out in the morning before I run and do boxing training. So I have really bad knees and wrists so I purchased these for regular atheletic training, doing some jogging, squats, jump rope, foot work. I got the wrist wraps for when I wouldn't be using the heavy bag or whatever so I didn't need my boxing wraps that'd naturally protect my wrists. So the wrist wraps by Gymreaper are great for push ups and planks, etc. when not needing full boxing wraps. Protect my wrists great! But the knee wraps I'm still struggling. They are very well made but maybe the material needs broken in? Everyway I've tried to use these, for example covering the bottom of the knee cap, the knee cap, top of the knee cap like they're made for was too restrictive feeling, and very uncomfortable. I then tried using these more as a brace, so wrapping mainly under the knee cap then going up above knee cap and finising the wrap there, it's a tiny bit better feeling but still doesn't feel comfortable. it almost makes me move so awkwardly that it's makes my knees hurt worse because I'm moving unnaturally.. I will update this review if I find the answer to my issue. I have not yet decided if I want to return these so for now I used one of the knee wraps for my lower back and it works great lol. I'm a 30\" waist just so everyone knows. but Gymreapers have a back quick lock strap that looks like it'd work great. I'm just doing this for now until I decide to return them or not. I suggest if you have the funds to do so, buy the knee sleeves by gym reaper. that's what I initially wanted, but couldn't afford it. I wish Gymreaper would lower it even 10$ to 49.99 seems way more reasonable for knee sleeves and I bet more people would be able to buy them, then resulting in more sales. 60$ is just too much. just my opinion. but if you can afford the sleeves, and just thought of the wraps to save money, I'd go with the sleeves.. but this also depends what type of compression and all that your knees needs. I also want to state I have not tried Gymreapers sleeves but in the past sleeves are very comfortable compared to most wraps."

Imagine, cutting your lawn, no matter the size, WITHOUT THE \"CHARGE THE BATTERIES FOREPLAY!\" Make no mistake, this IS the Electric Age. We abandoned Kerosene flashlights decades ago, and Lithium Batteries are appropriate for Phones, Computers, Weed Trimmers, Power Drills, AND Plug-In-Hybrid Automobiles, but not so for Lawnmowers (and Snowblowers.) WHY NOT? The power supply is \"Not THERE YET\".  We need to get the job done, one shot, right?, I estimate 3,500 Watt-Hours of power to trim my suburban lawn.  An EGO 56V 5Amp battery would provide 280 Watt-Hours.  Again these are estimates, but rounding, I would need 12.5 such batteries at 100% efficiency., The MM2000 uses a power source that is 100% compatible with what I already own-12or14 Gauge extension cords.  This is clean power.  Quoting the US Secretary of Energy, \"the power comes from the wall.\"  (No oil, gas, coal, nuclear.)  :+}  :=), It took less than 5 minutes to get the MM2000 out of the box and assembled, just attaching the handle with nice thumbscrew/levers, no tools needed.  The MM2000 has a full range of height settings, a mulching adapter, is nimble&lightweight (no batteries or gasoline weight to smash the grass down), and a great built-in fan above the blade that provides suction and picks up & mulches (compacts) leaves-NO RAKING. The left side \"EDGEMAX\" almost makes weed trimmers un-necessary in many landscaping scenarios. The collection bag is easily unhooked, & the opening fits perfectly into standard yard waste paper bags. All very neat., The two stage switch is very well thought out.  I cannot imagine the unit running \"accidentally\" but PLEASE, UNPLUG THE UNIT WHEN DOING ANY CLEANING OR INSPECTION. NOT HAVING AN EVER-PRESENT BATTERY MAKES THIS A V-E-R-Y  S-A-F-E Lawnmower.  THERE IS NO WAY THE MOTOR CAN TURN WHEN IT IS UNPLUGGED, RIGHT???, Now comes the classic objection-\"what about the cord?\"  THIS IS AN INANE OBJECTION!  Who cuts their lawn without 1 checking for children, 2 a mowing pattern, 3 checking for pets and wildlife, 4 checking for garden hoses and 5 checking for debris(potential projectiles)-CONTINUOUSLY?  So if an Environ-mentally Friendly extension cord is a problem, perhaps consider a Professional Lawn Care Service?, Buy a B&D MM2000 while you can and at a TERRIFIC PRICE ON AMAZON!"

I have the C677T MTHFR mutation, as well as a COMT mutation. MTHFR converts B-12 and Folate (and other vitamins) to the active/methylated forms that can be used by the body and cross the blood brain barrier. Because I have both MTHFR and COMT mutations, it is best that I take B12 in the form of Adenosylcobalamin (along with Methylcobalamin), which this product has. I was taking Thorne Methyl Guard Plus, which has a higher potency of Methylfolate and B12 Methylcobalamin (and no Adenosylcobalamin), but noticed it made me a little irritable, edgy. So after watching a presentation by Dr. Ben Lynch (MTHFR.net) \u2013 a leader in MTHFR research - I learned that B12 Adenosylcobalamin can help reduce irritability, anger, etc. that those with COMT mutations can have when they take too much methylfolate. This supplement has helped \u201ctake the edge off\u201d (pun intended). \\uf04a, This particular supplement formulation seems to work for me, my son and my father. I have noticed increased energy and mood stability and less irritability in all of us. And, as for my 90-year-old father, he was on antidepressants for 10 years (as well as on and off of them for the prior 55 years). 2014 blood work showed B12 deficiency, so he started B12 (cyanocobalamin) shots, but saw no improvement, and his antidepressants were gradually increased. In October 2015, his blood work showed he was in range for B12 and folate, but his homocysteine level was high.  Because of the research I had done on MTHFR, I knew right away that my dad had an MTHFR mutation, because (1) when blood homocysteine is elevated while B12 and Folate are in the normal range, that indicates the body is not properly converting folic acid to methylated folate and B12 (cyanocobalamin-synthetic form) to methylated B12 (active forms used by the body); (2) I had to get my MTHFR mutation from a parent. The form of B12 in the shots my dad was taking monthly is cyanocobalamin, which is synthetic and cheap and requires properly working MTHFR for conversion. So keep in mind that B12 and folate levels in blood work alone is not an accurate indicator of whether or not the body is actually converting to active forms required for the body to utilize. The addition of a homocysteine test is more revealing.  Since my dad started taking Thorne B Complex #12, he is completely off of antidepressants and doing well! His doctors are intrigued and impressed. I gave them the information and hope they will use it to help other patients.  Every person is different. It is best to start with lower potency supplements and work your way up to prevent reactions (in my case, reaction to too much methylfolate)., Dr. Ben Lynch has two MTHFR mutations himself, so he has a personal interest in this field. MTHFR.net is a FABULOUS resource for those struggling with MTHFR mutations, or those who want to find out if they have such mutations.  It is now believed that at least 50% of the population has some MTHFR variant (SNPs), which can cause a host of problems, including fibromyalgia, miscarriages, severe depression, autism and much more.  While there is typically not one \u201csmoking gun\u201d that causes all our ailments, I believe MTHFR is a good place to start. MTHFR.net can tell you which tests to have and where to get them.  I hope this helps someone!"

The 16-inch width of the dethatcher provides excellent coverage, allowing me to complete the task in less time compared to other models Ive used in the past.\", One of the standout features of this dethatcher is its user-friendly design. The adjustable depth settings make it incredibly versatile, catering to various types of lawns and which allowed me to customize the dethatching depth to meet my specific needs for debris removal. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to grip, and the machine is lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around my yard without feeling fatigued., \"I also appreciate the durable construction of the Rock&Rocker dethatcher. It feels robust and built to last, ensuring that Ill be able to enjoy its benefits for years to come. Additionally, the maintenance requirements are minimal, saving me valuable time and effort.\", \"What sets the Rock&Rocker 16-Inch 15 Amp Electric Dethatcher apart is its efficient performance. It effectively removes thatch and debris, promoting better nutrient absorption, water penetration, and overall lawn health.

Its powerful motor, adjustable settings, user-friendly design, and excellent performance make it a fantastic investment for achieving a healthy and beautiful lawn."

If I feel like I need another, or have been dragging around the last day or two, Ill take another at night.  I notice a major difference between this and other brands.  My original review is still below, and i have changed the rating from 4 stars to 5.\", -------------------------------------------------------, \"Im a firm believer in B vitamins for helping combat fatigue and lethargy (IF you have a B deficiency) but, even taking half of the dosage on here recommended per every TWO days, Im still p1ssing away money with this.\", I DO appreciate that they use the better quality ingredients and have no problem paying for that.  (That is why I gave 3 stars instead of 1.), I do NOT however, appreciate that even if you have a SEVERE deficiency in B vitamins, you will still end up not using 100% of this., \"Most of this will be passed out of your body as urine.  Your body does not retain extra, what it doesnt put to immediate use will be flushed away.  So while the bottle recommends 2 per day, most people could take 1 every 1-2 days and still get the same benefit, without antifreeze-colored urine.  1 pill by itself still encompasses more than 100% DV on everything except biotin and daily fiber (you shouldnt be getting your fiber from a b-complex regardless).\", \"Bring the DV more in line with reality and continue using the better quality ingredients and this would easily be a 5* product.  Dont get me wrong, I am actively using this product, BUT a large portion of it is wasted, something that is completely unnecessary.  Offer a product with better ingredients and less waste, and I will buy.\", \"*edit and update* Im still on my first bottle and am looking for alternatives, but Ive noticed several others dont have an extra ingredient that is beneficial to me - inositol.  Inositol (B8) does help with a handful of ailments Im dealing with, so Ill continue to take this and just continue my 1 pill every 1-2 days.  According to webmd, Inositol can help treat high cholesterol, psoriasis, ADHD, diabetic nerve pain (and a handful of others) alongside promoting hair growth.  While I would still like the daily values to be adjusted further, theyre still high quality ingredients, and better than most of the generic stuff.

It's not large. So don't buy it for a big lawn- I'd say, greater than 1/4 acre is too big. Get a bigger Greenworks., \"That said, I bought mine years ago. I dont know how many- 8 years? 10? Its been quite a while. Im STILL waiting for the battery to age out! I can mow my little lawn at my two-unit apartment (small postage stamp in the back yard, slightly larger postage stamp in the front yard) plus my somewhat larger yard at my house (still not large, but its a good sized city lot... think 1.5x a standard Chicago lot of 25x125 feet. Mine is 37x150 feet or so). At the end, I have 1 dot out of 4 on the battery. Note that this is after many years of use. I have been through 3 battery-dead cell phones during this time.\", \"My first cut this year at my house was through grass that was inordinately high. It did die in the middle of that. But the motor was exerting itself extra hard. Recharge took 2-3 hours. I didnt measure, I just came out later and finished the job.\", \"OK, that said: Its quiet. Much quieter than a gas mower. Save your ears! It stores easily over the winter. I  use mine and charge the battery to 2 bars, then let it sit over the winter. In the Spring, its ready to go!\", \"What else? It doesnt stink. Theres no cord. Its small, so you get more exercise. See? Its a positive! :-) For a battery-powered mower, with a kind of heavy battery, its pretty light. Easy to carry up the stairs out of the basement.\", A word to the wise: If you fold it down for transport- PULL THE BATTERY! I folded it down and inadvertently pulled on the start cord, and the thing started by accident! Yikes! Lesson learned, and no digits lost. The best kind of lesson to learn. So- learn from me, and save your digits., All in all, this was an unexpectedly great purchase, that is punching way above its weight in terms of features, performance, and overall quality of life experience in its task. Get one, your lungs ears and grass will appreciate it!"

USB C to A adapter can interfere with other USB plugins when used in a USB hub but they can be twisted to gain more space (see photo). Be sure to read the user manually as the FN key will be your best friend. It will allow you to use the arrow keys. One cool feature that I see is that the CapsLock key will be highlighted on a different color when active.\", \"I opted this red instead a blue switch one since it would be a little more quiet in an office environment. As the F1-12 keys and macros related are now on the numeric 1-9 rows, it makes things more reachable than before like play music, open browser, file explorer, etc... that other full size has but with longer reach. If you are a VIM user this is something nice to try out since everything is within your reach. It does feel small and crowded if youre used to with a bigger size keyboard.\", \"Id prefer to see some color coded key (similarly to a CapsLock on the FN key) to know which FN mode Im current at since there can be multiple and Id get lost sometimes if not careful and forgot the key bindings. For example, the numeric row would get disable or certain other keys, similarly to a FN lock feature. Itd be nice to have for new users but not really required. Users would eventually get used to it.\", Small build with full size functionalities, lighter weight and portable, a small size gaming keyboard with mechanical keys with RGB lightning suitable for all sort of activities. Comes with 4 replacement red switches by default and an USB C to A adapter as of this review as promotion."

I have two kids that are on car seats on the rear and they are causing a lot of mess with spilled drinks, snacks and all the mess normally present with kids. They are still on their car seats and they have car seat protectors that only covers where the seats are but not the corners and the middle seat., Installation is a bit moderate in difficulty. They could have made it easier with attaching to the back seat but they went with the latch in between the hinge of the seat which is harder and requires you to lower the back seat and every time you place it back, the latch goes back and then you have move the seat forward so you can hold the latch as you bring the back seat to upright position. Other than this part, it is ok and it is partially an exact fit. As you can see on the image, the seat is rectangle and did not conform to the bucket like seat. After securing the upper part to the headrest, it is somewhat contoured to the upper back seat which gives this somewhat of an ok design for something that is custom made for tesla. For its price, I think I would not ask for more at this point. The material feels tough and can withstand doggy nails. It feels waterproof and easy to clean and this should catch every spill and crumbs from my kids. It will keep my original seats in its pristine condition while giving me a peace of mind that then can eat whatever they want without the me having an anxiety. If you have someone that will not take care of your rear seats, this is a good investment. It does not look luxurious but people will understand."

I was surprised and overwhelmed when all of this came up as I searched for a new \"Litter Maid\". There were even hundreds of how-to YouTube videos discussing how to fix your \"Litter Maid\". This led me to realize I would need to do more research before buying a self-cleaning box and then I came across this one. I thought it would be a great option. I admit I was in a hurry and the price point made me think it may not be the best but I had two cats with nothing available to use.  I would try this in the meantime. I was stressed dealing with a flooded home, our family, our children, and the cats. I'm sure it was my mistake but somehow I thought it was like my Littermaid. It could be the proclaimed \"Self-Cleaning\" in the title. So please be aware this is NOT self-cleaning. It has no moving parts. It works on a sifting system. So you get the box, and you put the barrier grid in. After it is used sufficiently by your cats you roll it back and forth and the clumps go into the tray while the loose litter can sift through the grid to a different area. I found it only worked properly with the right clumping litter. If you get those little clumps or loose ones, you are right back to manual scooping, so why bother? This box can work under the right conditions, first I got mine for only $41 and change. It was the large multicat box, it was a covered box and there was little odor or tracking. I lined the waste tray with grocery bags for more hygienic, hands-free disposal. At that price, it doesn't cost much more than a regular pan litter box and I would rather roll and have the waste separated into a bag-lined bin than scoop. This however is not, in my opinion, a \"Self-Cleaning\" litter box. I didn't post pics as our box is not the cleanest at the moment but the seller's pics are perfectly accurate. I have no idea why anyone would purchase one of these for those I have seen priced $90 and greater. Like I said, NOT, self-cleaning."

Sure you could spend a few hundred more on something truly lavish, but this thing accomplishes a very simple and very important goal: I no longer have to worry about cat litter every single day. I can forget for a couple days and the machine has me covered. And at first I was disappointed that it doesnt have a cover, but believe me, you wouldnt want a cover. You need to be able to see where the machine makes mistakes.\", \"As I mentioned, the machine sometimes misses things. Sometimes chunks of stuff will end up stuck just out of reach of the rake, right on the very edges of the box. So you need to give it a helping hand there, and you also need to go in to the box 2-3 times a week and clear up any clumps of litter that might be solidifying in the corners of the box where the rake doesnt really touch directly. Sometimes if your cat wants to use the exact same spot in the box all the time, youll end up with the storage box overflowing just in that one spot, with nothing else in the rest of the reservoir. So really its wise to attend to the storage box and help remove clumps as soon as you notice it.\", \"And theres another reason you want to empty the storage box fairly frequently: the smell inside.\", \"So yes, realistically youre going to want to empty the box every couple of days, but the fuller it gets, the worse the smell gets, and it gets really bad if you let the box fill up. I would recommend just thinking of all that storage space as insurance for two-day vacations or if you forget for a while.\", I only noticed a couple problems., \"One, where the motor wasnt able to return fully to its docked position, and I got an amber light warning. I found out I had just carelessly allowed some litter to build up on the platform that the box sits on while docked, so it was interfering with the motor.\", And second, if you get a power outage, you will need to press the power button again manually. The machine does not turn itself on again after a power outage!, \"Once I figured that out, its been smooth sailing ever since. Fantastic product.\""

A quick examination revealed that the adjustment lever was having no effect on the blade height (rear wheel height). Upon disassembling the plastic housing, I discovered that the heigh adjustment lever was not connected to the bracket that connects to the rear wheel and there was pin to hold the lever in place on the wheel bracket. I reconnected the lever and the wheel bracket and then fashioned my own pin out of spare wire, thus fixing the issue. I was able to do this because I had the tools and some general troubleshooting experience, presumably this would have been a bigger for someone else, who perhaps not knowing what the issue was or how to fix it probably would have just sent it back for replacement."

So no complaning now that you actually have to push it., 1. Assembly -  Okay I get it the instructions stink! - But come on people there is only like 3 bolts and a Lock washer to put on.  Look at the pictures it is quite straight forward., 2. Height Adjustments - The wheels will come on the highest setting and I am not sure why they decided to do this as most people that buy a reel mower want to cut their grass low. - It will not go as low as a typical putting green but it will come close.  Perhaps a green that is about ready to be mowed at 0.5\"  while a fresh cut putting green is closer to 0.25\". - There are three slots on the mower for the wheels to connect to. As I said it comes on the highest setting (which is the lowest hole) Think of it this way if you lower the wheels you raise the mower to you want them on the highest hole for the bolt.  In order to remove the wheels, you first need to remove the green hub caps on each side to expose the Nuts.  The outside nuts on the wheels are 13mm and the inside bolts at 17mm so you will need one of each to remove and re-attach.  Take care not to slip off the gears inside Might fell off but was not too hard to reset and attach back on., The Second way to change the height are the roller wheels - These some on the medium height setting.  And with the wheels set to the lowest cut setting (position A in the directions) this is about 0.75\"  - move the roller adjustment to the top bolt hole on the mower for the lowest setting to get the 0.5\" cut height., 3. Cut - It nice a clean like a sissor compared to the suction and rip from a standard lawn mower today. If you are trying to cut more than 30% off the blades of grass you will likely need multiple passes., 4. Ease of use - okay this is going to depend on what type of shape you are in and what you lawn is like when you start using it.  The SHORTER you want the lawn the MORE OFTEN you will need to mow.  Don't complain that it is hard to get you 2\" grass to cut down to 0.5\" you are asking too much of any mower and that would be cutting off 75% of the grass (which is bad for the grass) - you should strive for 30% at most.  Therefore if you desire a 0.5\" cut, then you should be cutting grass that is no longer than about .75\" and since grass grows about 0.1 inch a day you would need to mow it every 2-3 days - most golf courses mow their greens every day., 5. Other Thoughts - My lawn is very mature and as such has a great deal of thatch near the soil.  I am going to either rent of buy a dethatcher to clean a lot of this up.  I am thinking that will allow the mower to cut lower with more ease.  I will update my results on the review., Over all -  It is what you are paying for -  it is a manual drive reel mower that you push.  The more out of shape you are and your lawn is the more work it is going to be.  Once you get the lawn trained to grow low it will get easier.  I have a section of lawn that I cut at the lowest setting on the traditional mower and that section this reel mower cut very well., \"Look for an update in a few weeks when I will add some Picts and video how tos.\""

So tidy and clean when not used, they shrink up very neat and little.  As I increased in length to 50 ft and 100 ft, I now see the only issue.  While its pressurized fully when you first turn it on, as soon as you use it, water and pressure is released, reducing your power significantly... until you stop and allow pressure to build up again. But the built up pressure is only instantaneous, it doesnt last long as water is being released. There is still pressure, just not as much as a regular hose which is more rigid and similar to right out of the spigot.  So I dont get as much pressure as my regular hoses, but the convenience of a 50ft or 100ft hose shrinking to 1/3 its size when not in use, is enough for me to use 90% of the time. This pressure effect is more pronounced the longer the hose. But boy, they are so much easier to store, and so much easier to use, so much more flexible. I love these and hope these last as long as my last one.\""

One of the least inexpensive ones I found and before I bought it had better reviews. I had to write one now after I\u2019ve had it for about 7 months. I\u2019ve had NO ISSUES. NONE. I have three cats and this is their only litter box until I purchase a second one for my closet. I say it\u2019s their only litter box because they will not go in their regular ones now only this ONE LITTER BOX! The app tells me they are going between 9-15 times a day\u2026 at this rate after this long I figured I\u2019d have issues and I havnt. I have seen online their customer service is great but I thankfully have not need them. It alarms when full which working 14-16 hour shifts 4 days in a row it\u2019s been life changing for both me and my cats. Even full, I never smelled the box. Two friends came over didn\u2019t even know I had animals. A little noisy but not as noisy as some I\u2019ve online and you can set it to not go off at night if you don\u2019t like it. The noise is not loud enough to wake me up at night either. Do not miss the label on do not push door when unboxing. I did and luckily stopped to look before damaging it. The ONLY, and I mean this, the ONLY issue I have with it is unhooking the claw for cleaning. Bring a pen or knife to help press the clamp down one at a time then pull together. I also have carpal tunnel so others may not have an issue with this. Cleaning is so simple once you get it down. Don\u2019t forget to place the litter box back inside BEFORE adding the litter when you clean it LOL. They send 2 claws which both have been working fantastic. For the price this one is amazing and I will be purchasing a second one. I will hopefully edit with a video."

I like that the controls are on the front rather than top., It is pretty big, we tend to use it when it is very hot and the frig cannot keep up with demand, for parties or to make extra ice in anticipation for parties. I suspect buying the ice would be cheaper, but this works well. It will NOT make ice fast enough to keep up with a giant party, so be aware you will need to make some in advance., First of all, this does NOT keep the ice frozen once it is made. You need to babysit it and remove the ice it makes and put it in a freezer if you want to keep it. So it may make 26.5 lbs of ice in 24 hours, but you would need to be emptying it about every  hour and adding more water. The ice it makes is softer than frig ice, but harder than the other ice maker we have in the family. It is the kind people like to chew, but if you put it in a regular freezer it will harden up and last longer in drinks. If you like soft ice, this is great., Depending on the temperature of your house, it does make ice every 9 min or so. They are bullet shaped cubes with an indent in the middle., It blows out hot air. This is simple thermodynamics, if you want to cool the ice maker cold enough make ice it has to remove heat. So that side fan will be blowing out fairly hot air.  It is pretty quiet, but you can hear it., If you do not empty it the ice cubes will melt and drip back into the water reservoir to be recycled., You should this sit upright for 2 hours if you move it around much, like a refrigerator. This means if you do not use up all the water you need to either scoop it up, or after you dump it, make sure you wait 2 hours before starting it again., One of my family members has an ice machine like this in the  dorm, and they are big hit there, they let it run all the time which is a huge waste of electricity, but then they do always have ice., It does not have a handle for carrying. That would be a nice addition."

This came with some sticker residue on some of the seats but I was able to remove it with nail polish remover. These covers were definitely not as easy to install as I was hoping. The install video makes it look easy and takes 15min to watch. Actual install took me over 2hrs. Difficult to get under the seats to clip covers and took some strength to get back seat covers on tight. But once completed they look very nice overall. I like that they provide full coverage. I do wish back seat covers for the bottom seat portion came with straps because they will come loose and need to be readjusted if you plan on lifting the back seats to get to the storage compartment under the seat. The drivers seat was also a little difficult to push cover material under the plastic that is near the controls of the seat and the front underside. The one thing that disappointed me most was that one headrest was stitched wrong. See picture attached how the stitching is different on one headrest compared to the other. I tried putting it on backwards but it did not fit that way. If I could get a replacement that would be nice. I also wish the trim edges were leather and not the burgundy fabric to make it look more real and luxurious. I did not install the center console cover as I felt that part looked the most fake and cheap. Could have a better fit. Lastly, red is more of a muted warm orangey red than a true bold red. Overall after installation, these covers look pretty nice and most wouldnt notice it is just a cover at first glance.\""

The design is aesthetically pleasing and wouldnt be an eye sore to have on a countertop.\", Ice production starts by first filling the water reservoir.  The water reservoir will produce about 2 full ice trays worth of ice before needing to be re-filled.  Be careful not to overfill or the ice will be sitting in the water.  The production rate is pretty quick and continuous and a full ice tray takes maybe 2-3 hours.  The ice maker will continue to run until either the water reservoir is empty or the ice tray is full.  If it is full, it will cycle on and off to maintain a full ice tray as it melts.  The ice tray is not refrigerated so it will naturally melt over time dripping back into the reservoir., The icemaker is somewhat noisy when the compressor is running on the ice maker.  It also produces a fair amount of heat while running.  I found it to be too noisy to keep on all the time.  I found it much more convenient to take the ice from the tray and store it in my freezer.  I could make a few pounds per day, fill up the freezer and not need to run the ice maker all the time.  The icemaker includes a small ice bag for storage in the freezer, but the bag is cheap and tore at the seam after just a few uses., \"The quality of the ice was good.  It produces some small to medium sized nuggets that have a decent crunch without being too hard.  Its not quite as nice as the fluffy stuff you could get at Sonic but still decent nugget ice.  Im not really an ice eater myself but I did find the ice worked really well for cocktails.\""

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: material durability of seat-covers-accessories\nReview text: \"I installed these seat covers in my \u201922 Tacoma and have now been using them for a month. Overall I like them very much and found a lot to like about them, yet they aren\u2019t quite perfect. I\u2019d rate the front seat covers a 5 all considered, but the rears just a 3 (and I got them for the fronts so Ill base my rating on that).\", What I like about these seat covers:, \u2022 Stitching is even; I didn\u2019t see any unevenness or blemishes during my install, \u2022 The material itself feels thick and sturdy. It is backed with foam., \u2022 Extra pocket on the front edge of the front seats. Perfect for a phone/wallet/parking access card, \u2022 Pockets in the back of the front seats. The Tacoma seats only come with a pocket behind the passenger seat, \u2022 They don\u2019t slide around. They fit well, have some inserts that go into the slot at the base of the seat/seat back, and have small rubber bumps on the backing. I didn\u2019t give the back seats as thorough of a test as the front., \u2022 Sturdy zippers at the top of the front seat covers, \u2022 Front headrest covers wrap around completely, \"\u2022 Sides are mostly open so you don\u2019t have to worry about impacting the side air bags. I dont trust an aftermarket item covering up that key safety device\", \u2022 The front seats seem to have a little more thickness on the sides where the bolsters are. Either this or the vinyl rather than OEM fabric gives me a more solid/cradled feeling in the seat. It feels sportier., \u2022 The color I got (black/grey) is similar to the pattern on the OEM fabric. The grey is a bit brighter and they add some openness to the cabin. It has a bolder sporty look also without being over the top., Some things to be aware of in case this matters to you:, \u2022 If you access the storage under/behind the rear seats frequently, the covers make it harder. Although there are 3 separate panels for the rear seat backs, the center panel velcros to the two side panels so you need to either fold both seats together or undo the velcro. Also since the factory seat bottoms fit together tightly, with the vinyl covers on it takes some extra tucking to make the covers fit flat where the bottoms meet., \u2022 Rear seat headrest covers just wrap over the headrests and don\u2019t include the sides. It covers the parts that can get dirty, but doesn\u2019t look as nice as the front headrests and are easy to bump off, \u2022 With the open sides on the front seats and the curved shape to the back, there is some looseness to the fabric. If you look you can see some of the foam backing. Most of the view of the open side and that backing is blocked by the pillar between the doors., \u2022 The pockets in the back of the front seat covers are 2 pockets; the Tacoma passenger seat had 1 longer pocket, Install notes:, \u2022 You could probably do the front seats quickly in 15 minutes or less. Installation took me about 90 minutes but I wanted it to all line up perfectly, and the back seats take a lot more effort as there are more pieces and they don\u2019t all wrap around, \u2022 The instructions are minimal but you can figure it out., \u2022 Look at the direction of the diagonals stitching on the seat covers; I put the rear seat back covers on upside down the first time. Probably no one would notice but I swapped them anyway, \u2022 The metal clips to go under the front seat don\u2019t have obvious connection points. On the driver\u2019s seat I connected them to the flattish metal bar holding the motors. On the passenger seat I wrapped them around the handle to adjust the seat and then connected them to each other. Maybe you\u2019ll find a better way., \u2022 The side straps on the rear seat backs looked different from the instructions. I fed the top/bottom strap through the single side strap"

Our cats are still getting used to it for the most part. We have 5 cats, 2 of them use the machine but they only urinate in it for now.  4 of our cats are male and they are large at between 15 and 20 pounds. They fit in the litter box part of the machine but just barely. They sit in it with their heads toward the back of the machine and their hind end in one corner at the front. I think it would be better if they learned to turn around so their head is at the front but not sure how to accomplish that.  Im thankful they are only urinating at this point because with how they are situating themselves, if they defecate in that position, it might not be inside the litter box.  Hopefully they will figure it out and all will go smoothly. The machine works as expected. The machine itself is relatively quiet when cleaning out the litter but the plastic trash bin that we upgraded to instead of the cardboard is more noticeably loud. The opening and closing of the lid that is done when the machine is emptying the waste is louder than the machine itself. I do like that the machine levels out the litter when its done cleaning. It works mostly well but does leave the last three inches or so of the liner with the litter mounded up like a sort of cliff of litter. I just take the included plastic shovel and level out the last bit myself. Still much better than cleaning the litter out as that is a task I absolutely hate doing. Oh, we use a mixture of 75% Sustainably Yours litter and 25% Dr. Elseys in case anybody needs a reference.  The machine doesnt have any issue filtering out the waste from the litter and the grate that filters the waste and then smooths out the litter when all is cleared out doesnt have any issue with the litter we use. My only real complaint is the app associated with the machine.  It is a hassle to get connected at first and for the first couple of days it was throwing errors back and was disconnecting from the machine.  After that, the app has worked smoothly thus far. All in all, I think this was a great purchase.\""

I realize this sounds insane and like no one would just keep popping their patella back into place every time it goes out for 21 years, never seeking further medical attention for the issue, especially as it continued to happen with increasing frequency. Its now at the point where it pops out at least once every month or two. Well, I have never claimed to be sane, and in my defense, the doctor I saw for the original injury said that I dislocated it so hard that it left permanent grooves in the cartilage underneath, and because of that, they would act as tracks and it would just keep dislocating, but there was nothing to be done for it. If you are wondering why I didnt seek a second opinion, its because he was the second opinion...\", \"Anyway, on to the brace... My knee has finally gotten so bad that I cant let it go any longer and am going to see an orthopedist again. Im pretty sure the soft tissue is so damaged that its virtually useless. I have tried almost every style of brace on the market (except the really expensive ones), and none of them have offered enough support in the right places and been comfortable to wear for any period of time... But then I found THIS brace!! I hadnt even realized how much pain my knee was constantly in until I put this brace on!\", 1) The inner silky sleeve which protects your leg from rubbing on the outer fabric, and is also breathable and moisture wicking is a complete game changer! One would think such a small detail would be insignificant, but in terms of comfort and wearability it makes all the difference in the world!, 2) The outer fabric is thinner and more light weight than most neoprene braces, making it more slim and comfortable, while still providing good compression and support. Also, the entire outside can be used to stick the velcro to, thus allowing you to position the straps exactly where you need them to be for optimal support., 3) The 2 extra patella support bands are AMAZING!!! They work far better than I ever could have imagined at keeping everything in alignment, and applying just enough pressure to give stability and relieve pain, without being too tight or uncomfortable, as they are fully adjustable., \"4) The side supports are great! They definitely offer necessary added stability. The brace does limit your range of motion some, but thats really the whole point of a brace, since too great of movements will only lead to further injury and damage of an already weak or hurt area.\", \"Hands down, this the the absolute best brace ever!!! The price isnt much higher than your generic designs, and it is well worth it! (Also, I visited the retailers store and received a 25% off coupon to use on Amazon for any of their products, so that was helpful). But even at full price its worth it. No other brace is designed quite as well, or offers the special features this one does. Plus, it is from a small business in the UK, designed by a guy determined to make a brace which would assist him with his own knee problems. The thought and care that went into making it is really evident, from construction to fit and function. It also comes with a 12 month warranty, and they send a paper with their contact info encouraging anyone who has an issue for any reason to contact them for resolution. They seem to be a good company who truly cares about their products and helping people. I very highly recommend that anyone with knee issues get this brace.\", \"The only suggestion I would make is for them to also make this in a plus sized version. Last year a medication I was put on caused A LOT of very rapid weight gain. Happily, stopping the med has reversed the process. But, had I tried to get this brace last year, it would not have fit my leg. Heavier people tend to have more joint problems, but there is a serious lack of good, affordable plus sized options of braces. I strongly encourage this company to fill that need. I am going to write to them regarding this issue. If you get this brace, or if you are a plus sized person whom this brace will not fit, I suggest that you also write to the company regarding this issue. Im sure if enough people do it they will see there is a need and will work to fill it.\", Thank you for reading my long winded review. I hope you found it to be helpful., \"Once more for good measure... BUY THIS BRACE!!! (you wont regret it).\", Namaste."

To my satisfaction, the customer support representative, whom Ill refer to as Popur, suggested a simple yet effective solution \u2013 adding more litter to the tray to ensure better leveling. This practical advice resolved the problem, and I appreciate the prompt and helpful response.\", Moreover, Popur informed me about the available customer support channels, including email support at support@popur.com and Facebook Messenger support (search for Popur on Facebook). Knowing that there are multiple avenues to reach out for assistance is reassuring, providing flexibility in communication., \"What stood out most in our conversation was the commitment to customer satisfaction. Popur extended an invitation to give Popur another chance to make things right, emphasizing their dedication to resolving any issues that may arise. The assurance of a 1-year warranty for the product, along with the promise of continuous support beyond the warranty period, is commendable. I was informed that most machine issues can be addressed through accessories or firmware updates, both of which will be provided even after the warranty period. The commitment to free service, regardless of warranty status, speaks volumes about Popurs dedication to its customers.\", \"Its reassuring to know that even if accessories may incur some charges post-warranty, the costs are kept reasonable. The emphasis on free service for any issue, regardless of warranty status, reflects Popurs genuine concern for its customers satisfaction and ongoing positive experience with their products.\", \"In conclusion, my recent interaction with Popurs customer support has left me with a renewed sense of confidence in the brand. The willingness to go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction, the provision of multiple support channels, and the commitment to ongoing assistance beyond the warranty period are all indicative of a customer-centric approach.\", I look forward to continued positive experiences with Popur and would like to express my gratitude for the excellent customer support received., Original review:, \"I recently made the switch from the 2nd generation of the Litter Robot to the Popur Automatic Litter Box in search of a more user-friendly and efficient solution for managing my cats litter. Overall, the Popur has proven to be a reliable performer with notable strengths and a few areas for improvement.\", The Popur is commendable for its ease of maintenance and efficient litter cleaning capabilities. However, there are a couple of drawbacks that have impacted my overall satisfaction with the product., One notable issue is the white caps covering the screws on the litter rake, which tend to come off easily during cleaning. Unfortunately, replacements for these caps were not provided, and their absence could potentially affect the long-term durability of the device., Another inconvenience is the design of the rake, which does not lift up for easy access to the area underneath. To clean this area thoroughly, the entire rake must be unscrewed and removed, adding an extra step to the cleaning process., Perhaps the most significant concern I encountered was with the customer service experience. The response time to inquiries was notably slow, taking up to two days to receive a reply. Furthermore, my specific issue regarding the incorrect time display on the device was met with generic troubleshooting steps that I had already undertaken. The lack of a direct customer service hotline for immediate assistance was a notable drawback., \"Additionally, the absence of information regarding the post-warranty period is a noteworthy concern. There is no clarity on whether the device can be repaired or if it becomes unusable after the warranty expires. This critical information should be readily available on the website or in the owners manual to provide customers with a complete understanding of the products lifespan and potential future costs.\", \"In conclusion, the Popur Automatic Litter Box offers notable advantages in terms of ease of use and efficient litter cleaning. However, the issues with the white caps, the rake design, and the customer service experience raise important considerations for potential buyers. Improved customer support responsiveness and addressing design flaws could significantly enhance the overall user experience with the Popur. Additionally, providing clear information on post-warranty support would instill greater confidence in the products long-term reliability.\""

But it loses a lot of points when it comes time to clean it....especially if your cat has diarrhea. As most cats dont have diarrhea regularly, Im not going to knock its rating down too far....but youve been warned.\", \"I take in strays and ferals. I currently have 9 adults and a litter of 7. My litter boxes get a lot of use. This is my third litter box of this type, plus Ive had the open box with the grate that moves type as well as a manual grate-sliding one and countless good ole ones with no cleaning ability. This is by far the BEST so far.\", \"Size-five stars! The smallest and lowest Ive ever had of this type, low enough to the ground that elderly and kittens can easily get in it. In one of my pictures you can see the box that I am replacing and you can see not only how high the opening is off the ground but youll also see an internal gray piece they must climb over. An old three legged cat I had last year could not get into that one and no way a kitten would either. This one is MUCH lower to the ground so that is not an issue.\", \"Odor Control-five stars! This one has a built in ionizer and its working quite well. In my other ones, all of which had a drawer on the bottom, I could smell when the drawer was half full. I have not smelled anything coming from this one (other than situation Ill mention below) and not known I had to change the bag until the light comes on and told me. The odor device takes about half an hour so sometimes Ive walked by immediately after a stinky event and can smell it, but overall, no.\", Collection Bag-five stars! The bag that collects things on this one is up on the side and the way it attaches makes it tight up against the plastic of the box. In the other ones you have an open bag sitting in a drawer and the smell just permeates up. This bag is easy to install and remove., Customer service-five stars! I had a piece break and they replaced it promptly and courteously., \"Loading it with litter- three stars. I wont lie, its tough and a hassle. The drum piece does not come apart or open up so litter must be put in via the front opening....so you cant just lift the bag/box of litter and pour. I tried standing it up so the opening was on the top and pour the litter in that way but then you cant see the min/max marks and so you have to pour a bit, stand it back up and level it to see where you are, repeat, etc. Hassle. I then tried scooping the litter out of the box with a cup and throwing it in and that too was a hassle as it just takes way too long. If you get the amount wrong, it ends up in the debris bag, so you have to hassle with it. The other hassle is that the min/max marks are molded into the grey plastic at the very back of the drum....so very, very, hard to see. They put a sticker near it which is easier to see but it didnt last long as my picture shows. Once youve got it loaded you have to level it. Directions are in the book but still, it just adds to the hassle. Luckily, once its filled it lasts quite awhile, even with 9 cats in the house.\", \"Operation-four stars. Its very quiet, you really cant hear it unless youre close. Mine was in the garage and I didnt hear it at all but now the kittens are using it so it was moved into a guest bathroom as I dont want them in the garage and I rarely hear it. I take a star away as it is slow, the whole thing takes a couple minutes to complete.\", Diarrhea/Cleaning-this is where it loses points. It cannot handle loose stools. I had a sick cat with some very thin and runny stool and it was an absolute mess. The litter (I use Slide) did not \"dry\" it out so as the drum started to rotate the diarrhea fell/rolled around inside the drum smearing on all surfaces. It was on the walls, in the orange grate piece and on both sides of the flap that drops it into the bag. It was then that I realized you can't disassemble this to clean it. I took it outside to use a hose on it but then realized that with the ionic device inside it I probably shouldn't get it wet (???). That left me with no alternative than to hold my breath, stick my hands and head inside (and it's dark in there so it's hard to see the smears) and clean it by hand. There is an orangy/yellow grate piece (see photo) and the clumps fall behind it, but with diarrhea the liquid went through the grate holes and smeared and stuck to them. This piece is screwed on and while the flash from my camera illuminated them, in real life I could not get them off and the diarrhea was all down inside that chamber. It was a disgusting job and I couldn't believe they could make something that was this hard to clean. If your cat gets diarrhea, put out an old fashioned box and save yourself what I went through!, \"Other things-I do not like the bright yellow ring of light and dont understand why it needs it. Its very bright, bright enough to be a nightlight in my bathroom. I like my nights dark and my cats dont need it either.\", \"I do have one cat who scratches/buries with a vengeance and there is a slight gap between the drum and the base and she manages to get litter in there and into the base. Thats what Im showing in the photo. I wish that gap was not there or had a cover or something.\", Cord is not long enough imho. I had to use extension cords as there were no outlets within reach of where this could/would go., \"Still the best of all Ive had so far with my biggest issue being you cant disassemble it for thorough cleaning.\""

Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in the performance!, Pros: lightweight even with two batteries installed, has a bit more torque than my 15 year old gas powered Honda. Ease of use and storage capabilities. Ability to adjust height with only one lever. Automatic switchover for batteries is a plus., Cons: 2x 4ah 80v batteries did not cut half of my 7500sqft yard., Severely lacks the ability to be pushed over taller grasses. You MUST use the self propelled feature in order to efficiently cut over taller grass., Battery life is horrible, I don't know how others claim they can cut their entire 1/4 acre yard, 5\"tall grass, with only one battery. Maybe if it was 2\" tall perfectly crispy dry grass and you're height setting is at maximum. A tiny bit of dew and you can kiss the battery life and performance goodbye!, \"It doesnt mulch very well and clumps up pretty quickly after a couple of passes, I had 10+ times where the mower could not cut anymore grass and would simply choke out and stall.

It may feel sharp, but believe me, it is far from sharp., \"Whatever greenworks claims in their description, cut those performance numbers by 75% and youll have an accurate depiction of is true performance. Imagine it was the rainy season, the grass would need to be cut every 2 days in order to prevent choking and stalling from taller grass.\", Turbo button \"sounds\" like it adds a bit more power, the reality is that it only consumed more battery life and provides a nominal performance upgrade, it'll still choke out on taller grass., \"If youre into mowing your yard every other day, than this is the perfect mower for you. Otherwise, stick to the fossil fuel burning, carbon emitting, exhaust gas smelling mower we all know and love.\", I gave greenworks a solid chance to prove itself on my mediocre size lawn and their 80v power equipment was simply disappointing, at best."

Its kind of a zone-type RGB. Kind of hard to describe. It does have different modes for the RGB and you can control the speed and brightness of the RGB. Its super easy to control the RGB by just using the function key and certain keys on the board. The RGB looks quite nice. My only complaint with it is that Ive noticed a low sort of humming noise when the RGB is on. It doesnt seem to impact anything but its something Ive noticed. It goes away when I turn the RGB off.\", \"Keycaps: These are going to be your standard ABS-type keycaps. Theyre going to get shiny after heavy or regular use and the subtle texture on them will begin to wear off. The quality of the printing on the keys isnt stellar, but is acceptable. It seems like they could have used another coat or two of ink. One thing I will mention is that the quality of the machining of the keycaps varies wildly. I took the keycaps off and the edges of many of them are jagged and could use some sanding. It doesnt seem to impact the keycaps while theyre on, but its something to keep in mind.\", Sound: This keyboard is kind of loud. Particularly, the stabilizer pieces rattle. The keyboard has two springs inside it that are removable. The rattle seemed to be the worst on the enter and right shift key., Cord: Type-C cord, fits in the top of the back of the board and attaches via USB., \"Mod Potential: I removed the keycaps and stabilizers and lubed them all with 205g0. I also applied dielectric grease to the end of the stabilizers. I removed the springs inside the spacebar because they seemed to add to the rattle. The keyboard sounds and feels much better since lubing. I havent unscrewed anything so Im not sure what the PCB looks like or what the inside of the case looks like.\", \"OVERALL: For the price, this is a great keyboard. I use it for gaming and everyday typing. Its not going to be amazing quality in every area, but for what youre paying, its great. Youre getting a compact 60% keyboard with good-looking RGB. I really have no complaints at all and am very happy with my purchase. I recommend the keyboard for those looking for a cheaper keyboard option.\""

Lawns where you actively hate the grass and all who mow it. Deserts and wastelands., For real though, the highest height setting on this mower will cut your grass down to the root.  Even then, you will be using your full bodyweight to push through even moderately tall grass., If you look at your lawn and think, \"It's time to cut the grass,\" it is too late to use this mower.  Moderate grass will cause it to clog and die.  Tall grass will just push the mower back, laughing at it like a bully., The airflow on the mower is so bad that it will sputter and die unless you lilft it up and shake out the grass every few feet, whether you are using the bag attachment (which has a laughably small capacity) or the vent attachment.  The bag capacity is roughly enough to require you to empty it 4-5 times for a small yard., \"This is the ideal lawnmower for an apartment with a tiny, enclosed lawn of clover or other short, soft grass.  Or fake grass that doesnt need mowing.\", \"It is so light that it has virtually no traction, but the added weight of lugging around an extension cord just makes this a tedious and exhausting tool to use.  Thats generally a problem with any corded mower, but its particularly noticeable because this lawnmower is such garbage at its job.\", \"Its entirely made of plastic, and feels flimsy and unstable. Its easy to assemble, which is good, because the handle shakes itself loose often.

Plus a full walking mower was overkill. The design idea is amazing. But I would have preferred a sturdier design, swivel wheels, more power, shorter battery charging time and stronger string, even if it cost a little bit more. The bottom wheels do not swivel/pivot and are easily detached. This tool needs a delicate touch with motions much like a vacuum and less like a mower. I have an electric eco trimmer and was hoping for a similar kind of power and strength without the hassle of grass thrown on my clothes. Since nothing better is out there, I\u2019ll keep this trimmer. It kind of feels like a toy. If anyone has kids wanting to try mowing, the handle adjusts to height. This product could definitely be used by beginners as long as they are supervised and given safety instructions.\""

I DO pick up large sticks prior to mowing, but it easily rides over small ones., The mower does occasionally  get hung up on a mid-size stick, but a half a roll backwards and it\u2019s  dislodged - no big deal! It does a marvelous job, takes up only a small amount of garage space and is easy to maintain! I run a blade sharpener over the blades once a month since my lawn is large and give it a shot of WD40 and it\u2019s all good! I am a fit middle age lady and had no trouble assembling or using this mower myself. The only thing that has slowed my mowing down, are random folks stopping me to ask about my old-timey mower! I encourage them all to  give one a try! Definitely recommend the 20 inch if your lawn is large. I have owned this mower for 6 months, and besides some minor fraying of the foam handle grip, have not had any issues or required any repairs. LOVE it!"

The size is nice to move your mouse around--I play at 60-70cm/360 so having more mouse space is a must for me. The one I ordered has red switches which are more favoured for gaming compared to blues or browns. I must say that this is my first 60 percent keyboard and I dont mind missing the arrow keys, Numpad, or function keys. I can use the FN key at the bottom right and press keys with a second function. In my experience, it wasnt annoying and dont miss dedicated keys for home, del, PgUp, etc. In fact, those keys are closer now. I can hold FN with my right pinkie and use my other hand or fingers to hit the other keys just fine. For example, I hold FN with my right pinkie and use my index, middle and ring finger to use the arrow keys. Furthermore, The switches themselves have a fence around the cherry MX stem so wobble is reduced somewhat.\", \"However, I have several gripes with this keyboard. The first is the sound, there seems to be some faint rattles and pings if you listen closely but it shouldnt be a problem if you dont pay attention to it. The bigger keys have bad stabilizers as they feel restricted and not as linear compared to the smaller keys with no stabilizers. In other words, the smaller keys feel smooth but the bigger ones feel rough; the spacebar is an exception though. The keycaps feel like they are made out of ABS plastic and arent PBT, but they have texture to them so it will take longer to oil out--it looks different from the fabricated product images. Moreover, the cable is bit short as I needed to use my longer usb-c cable from my TKL and use it. The cable it comes with is not braided and only one colour (blue) is available for lighting.\", \"Despite all the gripes, I am happy with the keyboard especially because of how much I paid for it. It is cheap and I dont mind eating while gaming with it or smashing it in a fit of rage (btw it has little flex). I could easily buy another one if it breaks. Id say its worth the price and I recommend it if you dont use it to type but to game.\""

It is a pretty impressive performer, but sadly has one serious design flaw., When operating at full output, it does a fantastic job of mowing cleanly and packing clippings into the bag. Unfortunately the machine only operates at full output when it meets with cutting resistance above a certain threshold. This is clearly intended by the engineers to extend battery life, but there is no way to force the machine to operate at full output. This should be a user-selectable option. I own many LXT products and have several dozen batteries. I couldn\u2019t care less about battery life, so I regret that there is no way to force full-time operation in high-output mode., Upon reading numerous reviews for makita\u2019s larger LXT mowers, I get the impression that all of them share the same limitation.

The 100 foot length is really nice, although 50 foot models are offered as well) as even for this length of hose, it rolls/coils up very small, taking a lot less space on the hose holder than a comparable standard hose.  It also has brass connections, a very big plus as the hoses with aluminum fittings end up corroding and not sealing very well., The hose also includes an adjustable spray nozzle (color matched too!) that uses a thumb control valve that is so much easier to use than most lever controls.  The assortment of spray patterns is pretty much the same as many others giving you 10 different spray patterns., \"So far, everything looks to be a great hose, but to be honest I havent had or used it long enough to know the durability or how long it will last.  Overall, this hose has lot going for it and although its not the cheapest compared to some other models, having the spay nozzle and brass connections make this a worthwhile investment.\""

In the box it weighs about 8 pounds and folds up to a small, easily stored 13\" x 11 1/4\" x 5 1/2\" size., The bed comes with a small but powerful pump that can run off your car accessory plug or house current using two supplied adaptors. The pump takes less than a minute to inflate the orange mattress and just a little more time for the surrounding white colored bed. The Mattress and bed section have only 1 inflation valve each - meaning there is only 1 large chamber in each piece. This is good for quickly adding air but not so good if you get an air leak. A single puncture in either piece will cause a full loss of air pressure., The bed is soft and comfortable. The orange mattress has a velour-like finish that keeps it from sticking to your skin. The white section of the bed is used to hold the orange mattress and provides bolsters on both sides to keep the kids from rolling off the mattress., The plastic used in the construction of the bed is about the same weight and thickness as a large inflatable pool toy., \"This is a good child size bed to keep around the house for random use. Its also light and small enough to take with you on trips and vacations. It makes a soft comfortable bed that can be set up in minimal space. The bed comes with a pump that inflates the mattress and surrounding support piece in just minutes. And when the night is over, the bed folds up small and can be quickly stored away waiting for the next use. And I really like the side bolsters that keep the little ones on the mattress.\", The bed does not offer the strongest or best construction but works fine for random use when needed.

I revved it up, and the grass trembled like it was in a hurricane evacuation.\", The 21-inch cutting deck is like a grass guillotine (but less gruesome, of course). It glided through the unruly blades with the precision of a surgeon, leaving a trail of neatly trimmed grass in its wake. I almost heard a choir singing \"Hallelujah\" as I mowed., \"But wait, theres more! The adjustable cutting height is like a grass stylists dream come true. Its a salon for your lawn \u2013 whether you prefer a buzz cut or a more laid-back trim, this mowers got you covered!\", Now, let's talk about the brushless motor. Not only is it powerful, but it's also quieter than a snoring hedgehog. I could almost hear the grass whispering, \"Thanks for the trim, mate!\", \"However, every hero has its Achilles heel. This mower, though a grass-grooming superhero, might struggle a tad with overly long and damp grass, making it a bit grumpy, much like waking up on a Monday morning.\", \"Maneuverability? Smoother than a well-kept lawn! The ergonomic handle and effortless push made me feel like a lawn whisperer. Plus, its cordless, so no tangling with pesky cords while dancing through the daisies!\", \"In conclusion, the Greenworks 80V Cordless Lawn Mower is a game-changer in the world of yard maintenance. Its a lawn-transforming machine that turns mowing into a delightful chore. So, grab this mower, embrace your inner lawn artist, and sculpt that grass canvas like a boss!\""

I compared them to similar seat covers, and none of them fully covered the headrests like these ones do., The material quality of the seat covers is excellent with a soft feeling. I feel great comfort during both short and long drives., The cleaning and maintenance are a breeze, finally freeing me from worries about kids getting my car dirty., Cons:, The installation does require time and patience, but thankfully they provided a step-by-step installation video that I found very well done and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching the installation video before attempting to install the seat covers as it greatly aids in a successful installation. Even with that, it still took me 2 hours., While the majority of the seat covers fit perfectly, the one for the power seat required minor adjustments, which took a bit of extra effort and patience., Do I love the seat covers? Of course I do, they look amazing. Despite the time-consuming installation process, the overall performance and value they offer make them a worthwhile investment, these are definitely the best seat covers outside of a $800+ dealership package. Only time will tell on how long they last but for now I am very happy with them."

Niacin side effects can include a niacin flush, which is when someone temporarily experiences red, warm and tingling burning and/or itchy skin after taking a niacin supplement. This happens because the capillaries expand and increase the flow of blood to the skin\u2019s surface. A niacin flush is a common visible reaction to high doses of niacin or a niacin overdose. It can look and feel somewhat like a sunburn, but it typically begins 15 to 30 minutes after taking niacin and only lasts for about an hour.  The \"flush\" is what's providing the health benefit to the body., Appreciate the convenience of the B spectrum in one bottom with great taste. This is a solid product in our household with three kids with MTHFR. We have no reactions, but are also all deficient in B vitamins due to the gene mutation.

But NOT with this hose.\", \"This hose fixes that problem - the problem of weight - and the attendent problem of the size of a longer hose.  While this hose retains (and actually increases) the flexibility and durability (since it has a very nice multi-layer construction and appears to be well-made with good quality materials including brass fixtures and good rubber washers that should last a long time), its is still super light weight and when not in use (when theres no water / water pressure in it), it shrinks to a very manageable size.  Brilliant.  This also helps if you have to run it across a driveway since it doesnt have to be rigid, it can more easily deal with being run over.\", \"The hose hanger that it comes with is a bit of a pack in - not sure Ill use that - and the nozzle that it comes with is passable (its one of the plastic types that has multiple settings) and works just fine, but there are certainly better.  But for the price - and what this is advertised as - the hose itself is amazing and actually makes me look forward to watering unlike our older, heavier hoses.\", So if you could use a lighter, easier to deal with hose, then this is a great one to get.

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: height adjustment of walk-behind-lawn-mowers\nReview text: I returned from over two months on the road to find our summer landscaper had taken a very \"lassez faire\" approach to maintenance, giving my first run with this new mower a bit of an extreme test. Photos attached show before, first strip, completed, and the mower ready for storage after all was done., The mower arrived in perfect condition, a big  and heavy box, but well protected by extra cardboard inserts. Assembly was easier than I expected - the clever storage design gives it a compact fold and I just had to unwrap and insert the top handlebar. That fit very easily with perfect alignment of a couple of bolt & nuts - no wrestling to get holes aligned as with many home assembly products., \"I charged up the batteries the day before - they arrived with some charge, but well below half. I set the height to the max level and didnt use the bag attachment at all after trying it out for fit. Ill use it some and experiment more with height, but for a first mow in months that seemed best.\", I'm used to mowing with an 18\" corded electric push mower. I was pleasantly surprised that this one is still pretty easy to maneuver when turning or manually pushing. It's heavier of course, but the big rear wheels worked well for me., \"I didnt really make use of the Turbo mode, really just forgot about it and found its standard run worked well enough for this tall job. I did extra passes in several spots to cover all the tall & thick growth. The lawn is roughly level, though some slopes you definitely notice if pushing a mower through thick grass. The Greenworks did all the work for that, my only real exercise were occasional turns that I got smarter about minimizing as I used it more.\", Both the big 25\" width and cordless operation were huge time-savers for me. I did the whole lawn in one run over about 80 minutes. Used the self-propel almost that whole time, at its slowest speed. The mower uses one battery at a time and has a level & usage indicator on the handle, so when the first was drained I paused to put it in the recharger. The 2nd battery was drained at about 80 minutes, but by then the 1st was back up around 50% and had plenty of juice for me to finish up at full power. As the 2nd battery approached 0%, it felt like the propel power was dropping, but blades kept at full speed until a quiet shutoff when all power was gone., It took me a little practice to get the hang of the separate propel & blade controls, but also to change my old mowing pattern. That used to be driven by minimizing cord issues. A circular pattern also lets the self-propel wheels do more work than my old way with adjacent stripes. When self-propel is cut off, the rear wheels hold a little bit of a lock, but a slight wiggle or turning on just one quickly releases that and made turns easy to do. Re-engaging the propel motors was an easy reach for me without needing to restart the motor., Finally, storage really is pretty handy. Very compact and stable, taking less space than my old 18\" mower with no clever folding design., No notes at all for me, very happy to have had this upgrade ready for what should be the toughest mow this yard has seen in some time, or for years to come."

There is no strong odor associated with this bottle., HOW TO TAKE?, The suggestion is to take this with a cup or two of water.

As a seasoned mechanical engineer, I have an innate passion for technology products. I spent a month researching various brands of automatic cat litter boxes until I stumbled upon Charmkits product on Amazon, and Ive been using it for a week now.\", Advantages:, Safety System, Charmkit employs a safety sensing gate design. After a cat uses the litter box, the machine attempts to close the gate after 20 seconds. When a cat approaches within a 50cm range in front of the machine, the sensor responds, halting the gate-closing command, and retrying after 15 seconds. To be frank, during the initial three days of using the product, Leon was repeatedly drawn to the sound of the gate closing, approaching it constantly, which resulted in cleaning sessions taking around 10 minutes. However, as of now, they have grown accustomed to the sound, and the machine operates swiftly., Sensor Quantity, \"Their design team wisely allocated resources where it matters most - product safety. The number of sensors it comes equipped with is the most extensive Ive seen so far. This includes a radar sensor in front of the machine with a range of 50cm, infrared sensors at the entrance, four gravity sensors at the bottom of the machine, two infrared sensors inside the waste compartment, and an internal motor anti-jamming cat detection current system. Compared to other brands that rely solely on radar sensors and gravity sensors, I personally believe Charmkits product offers more comprehensive cat proximity detection.\", Physical Deodorization, \"Clearly, the Charmkit team conducted in-depth research on other brands odor elimination methods and consulted professionals. They incorporated air purifier fresh air system technology to exchange air with the external environment to eliminate odors. Frankly, Im not a fan of chemical deodorizers or some brands aroma generators, and Im unsure if my cats would adapt to them. However, they have also provided a space for customers to place deodorizers if desired.\", Disadvantages:, Network Configuration Issues, \"I encountered an error when initially trying to connect to the 5GHz Wi-Fi network. Later, I turned off the 5GHz feature on my Wi-Fi router, connected to the 2.4GHz successfully, and then re-enabled 5GHz without any issues. This was a communication problem I discussed with the customer support team and was resolved satisfactorily. The complexity of each households network environment can be a factor.\", Unsuitable for Placement on Carpets, \"I initially placed the machine on a carpet and it detected Lilys weight as exceeding my expectations. After reviewing the manual again, I learned that it must be placed on a flat, non-carpeted surface for the gravity sensor to function effectively.\", Repetitive Information Push Notifications, Their camera utilizes motion detection, resulting in my receiving notifications on the app whenever my cat passes by the litter box. However, my cat Lily is quite active, so I would receive numerous notifications throughout the day, prompting me to disable this feature. The customer support team actively communicated with me and promised to optimize the types of notifications pushed."

It cuts too low -- youll burn the grass in the summer even at the highest possible setting.\", \"I originally thought there was no way to adjust the cut height -- its not obvious.  However,  it can be adjusted and once you see how its pretty  clever and not that hard.  I like it except that it doesnt adjust ENOUGH.  So it is a) too low for summer for sure; and b) so low youre cutting a lot with very little power.\", \"I spend more time clearing jammed grass from it and restarting it then I do actually mowing.  Its stalls and/or jams a couple of times a pass even on the highest level unless you cut weekly.  After a while, you also cut up your hands trying to quickly clear grass stuck between the blades and the egress port.... not an issue if you dont get impatient I guess, but as much as you are clearing grass .... hard not to.\", The grass catch is also tiny.  I use it for his front yard, but I just let it spray out in the back yard... having that \"mulch\" cover helps to keep the grass from burning anyway as low as it cut.  We replaced an electric mower that had a weak battery.... anymore we don't use this for the front.  The battery one can do the front, we just got tired of having to charge twice: once after the front, and then halfway through the back again.... VERY week battery in the old mower, which is 10y old., \"Additionally, the handle is pretty low ... but I am a bit tall and my son is taller, so this is an issue for most lawn mowers for me... its not that different from others... just a tad lower since its on the small side.  The only reason its worse than other mowers is that typically you are trying to lift the front up to stop from stalling as you cut the grass to carpet height :(\", Very dissapointed... and too late to return.

I've had corded and I've also had battery operated ones.  Out of them all, I've had the best luck with corded mowers and weed whackers.  Out of those, I've had the best luck with Black+Decker.  The corded devices delivered more consistent power when compared to battery operated ones.  The cords were annoying until you got used to them and I've found that starting on the yard that's closest to the the power outlet worked the best.  As you move further away from the outlet and the cord \"spools\" out, it doesn't tend to be in the way as much.  I occasionally have to move  the cord out of the way, but it's not that bad.  Also, when I'm mowing or weed whacking, I find that using a steady and \"easy\" motion the best.  ie.  Not faster than a slow walk.  For the mowers, going down a line and then backing the mower up along it's path worked the best.  Kind of like when you use a vacuum cleaner.  You'll get the cleanest cutting path and will be less likely to have rough patches.,   My yard is a hodge podge of different types of grass from years of me experimenting to see which types of grass I liked better, weeds that grew in between and into the different patches, and finally from me giving up on trying to find the \"perfect\" type of grass to have.  So it's quite \"cosmopolitan\" if you get my meaning.  So all the mowers and whackers I've used over the years have gotten quite a workout.,   Having said all that, here is my review on this mower., Pros - Love the power and compactness of it.  The design of the blade is a joy and I like how it whips up the grass/weeds into itself for a more even cut.  The power of the motor is very much in evidence.  My last mower was the smaller version.  It had a less powerful motor and smaller AoE.  Folded up, this new mower folded up smaller than my older mower!, Cons - The mower is light.  I'd have to say too light even.  Some types of grass are very compact and can hold up quite a bit of weight.  My last mower I ended up having to put about 30lbs of weights onto it to help make sure it sank down far enough so that it could get a good cut on some of the more dense patches of grass I have like emerald zoysia.  Sadly, that led to \"bad\" spots on those patches that took time to grow over.  Once it greened over and I got it used to being that short, everything was fine as long as I maintained my regularly scheduled mowing., \"  The blade isnt replaceable?  This one Im not 100% sure on as I thought I remembered seeing a posting saying that it wasnt?  I dont recall seeing a replacement blade for sale anywhere though when I looked.  I like to have a few replacement parts on hand for stuff that I think might need it down the line.  Like the blade itself.\",   The mower is not really \"to the edge\".  The wheel base is wide.  It almost looks like a go-cart.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it's actually a better idea to use an edger to get tight spots and the edges of the yard.  Some folks might be disappointed though that the mower can't cut all the way to the edge of their yards., Suggestions - Either make the mower heavier and/or make the wheels have a smaller \"profile\".  Almost the entire body of the mower is a hard plastic.  Makes it light as heck, but is actually bad for denser grasses.  The mower \"rides\" on top of the grass instead of sinking down far enough to get a good cut.  If the body was heavier that'd help.  The wheels are a little wide and also made of plastic (again, super light).  If the wheels had a smaller profile, they'd sink into denser grass more.  Maybe a combination of the two would work best?, \"  Also, I recall a comment made that this mower doesnt roll well across mud because its so light?  Id like to kindly remind that soul that, after all is said and done, its a corded electrical device!!!  What the heck are you doing trying to use a corded electrical device in mud!!!  Let me guess, youre also the type of person that thinks its ok to use a hair dryer while in the bath/shower?!?\""

But we have a small lawn so theres really no point in Us having a huge lawn mower that takes gas or electric. So finally I talked him into it And this thing is great the first time you use it if you havent Mowed the lawn in a while It will be difficult to mow because of the height of the grass. But after some upkeep , youll be fine. The other thing to keep in mind is if you get stuck on a clump of grass. Thats kind of thick. It does take a bit to get it cut but its really not bad. Personally, I love mowing the lawn because of this thing. Its a good workout and its quiet , and you can do it at any time of the day , so youre not disturbing anyone. Its also light, so if youre living in a place where youre in a row home and youre in the middle this way you can carry it through your house to the front or back. And its not too heavy to carry. That way , you dont have to walk it down the alley or figure out something else. Its honestly really nice and such a good workout like I said, and it makes me really enjoy mowing the lawn. as a short  woman its not very hard to push. I am pretty strong but Im also really short. So big things are kind of hard for me to move if theyre too tall but its not bad for me. Im very much an outdoor person. So I like taking care of the yard and I also love being independent so this way I dont need to constantly ask my husband whos super tall to help me pick things up or move them. And I can just do it on my own. I wish we never got away from using lawn mowers like this. It really is great, especially if you have a small lawn, but even if you had a big lawn and you like being outside doing yard work And just working out in general , its such a great workout , so you should try it. I will say you will need someone to help you put it together if you need a lot of upper body strength. So my husband helped me put the rest together. Because I had a hard time hooking the blades in but it was great. It didnt take long to put together either.\""

That being said, I will do my best to judge the product based on its current price of $36.99.\", \"So, I purchased this keyboard because my previous mechanical keyboard braking in less than a year after purchasing it. I wanted a product with blue-mechanical switches (Personally, the brand of the mechanical switches doesnt matter that much, as long as they feel good to type on I think its fine) as those are my personal preference. So, I decided to give this keyboard a shot, and I think I made a wise decision.\", \"To start off, typing on this keyboard feels great. The key caps are a bit louder than Im used to in blue switches, however thats going to be a bigger problem for my room mate than it will for me. Even the spacebar, a button that is typically the weakest in many cheaper mechanical keyboards feels great.\", \"As for the lighting, I was initially worried that I wasnt going to like the rainbow pattern of the keys. That being said, I actually like it quite a bit when looking at it in person. I should point out that there is no way to change the color of any key, but for this price point that isnt that surprising. But, if you dont like the rainbow pattern, there are probably better choices out there for a similar price. That being said, there are various effects that can be done with the LED keys. These effects are listed on the product page if youre curious.\", There are only a couple of downsides I can think of with this keyboard., -The rubber grips on the keyboard work well, however there are no rubber grips on the stand pieces, meaning that the keyboard can be shifted if you accidentally push it., \"-There are holes on the bottom of the keyboard that are clearly there for an ergonomic wrist-rest that can be attached to the keyboard. While the page listing doesnt indicate anywhere that a wrist-rest would be included, having one would of made the product even better.\", \"Overall, if youre looking for a good budget gaming keyboard, I think this is a pretty decent option.\""

Im not sure Id want to pay the asking price on this, but if it continues to provide the level of quality that it seems to have on initial assessment, then I would do so.

This inflatable mattress combines practicality, durability, and comfort in a package that exceeds expectations., \"The queen-sized design provides ample space for a restful nights sleep, ensuring that you can enjoy the comforts of a bed wherever your adventures take you. The 18-inch height elevates the sleeping surface, giving it the feel of a traditional mattress and making it easy to get in and out of bed with ease.\", The inclusion of the electric pump is a game-changer. Setting up the mattress is a breeze, taking just a few minutes to achieve the desired firmness. The pump is efficient, and the ability to adjust the firmness to personal preference adds a layer of customization that caters to different sleep preferences., Portability is a key feature of the Cirtek Air Mattress. When deflated, it packs down to a compact size, making it easy to carry and store in the included travel bag. This makes it an excellent choice for camping trips, overnight stays, or as a temporary bedding solution for guests., Durability is evident in the quality construction of the mattress. The puncture-resistant material ensures that it can withstand the rigors of outdoor use, providing peace of mind when setting up camp in various terrains. The reinforced seams add an extra layer of sturdiness, contributing to the overall longevity of the mattress., Comfort is at the forefront of the Cirtek Air Mattress design.

That is the singular difference between this KUMIO and my previouc ice maker - the lid design. The KUMIO just has a clear piece of plastic, not insulated, and even thinner than my previous ice maker!\", Fortunately all the parts are interchangeable - the lid, the ice tray, etc, can all be borrowed from my old unit if I ever have problems., \"One other problem I had right off the bat - I could hear it trying to pump water, but it was only a trickle. After close inspection with a flashlight, I saw a plastic shaving on the bottom that was clogging up the intake line. I just rinsed it really well and was able to solve the problem. But be aware, these are generic imports with low levels of quality control, be prepared to do a little troubleshooting if it doesnt work out of the box.\", Despite its limitations, the KUMIO unit is working fine, and I think it will last about a couple years just like my previous unit. However, here are a few things to keep in mind:, \"1) The ice maker isnt refrigerated, so the ice melts and drips back into the water tank if you dont use the ice right away.\", 2) This ice maker produces very small, hollow ice cubes. The fast mode makes 9 tiny ice cubes weighing a total of 0.9 ounces, which is about 1/10th the size of a normal ice cube. The larger ice cubes weigh about 40% more, and also take about 40% longer to make., 3) You need to wash it out frequently, especially if you live in a muggy climate, since it can get dirty and slimy on the bottom. I add a few drops of silver or iodine to prevent bacterial growth., \"4) This ice maker is not great for travel or parties. It makes tiny ice cubes very slowly and does not keep them cold, so its not enough to keep up with a party. Also, its bulky to carry around. And its not ideal for camping either since its 120v.\", Overall, I liked this ice maker enough to order another one, and we use it for supplemental ice. However, keep in mind its limitations."

Reel blades cut a healthier grass., \"6. Easy storage, doesnt take up much space or omit gas fumes.\", Bad, 1. Cuts narrow rows, would not be practical on a big yard., 2. Finicky about debris and uneven terrain., \"3. Doesnt cut all weeds and supposedly doesnt work well in all types of grass.\", 4. Can leave uneven patches that need multiple passes if grass is longer and laying flat., Basically this mower is great if you have a relatively small yard with a smooth established lawn., This specific push mower is good because it has five 16\" blades and a sturdy handle, (I didn't want a \"T\" handle as they seem flimsy). 16\" is fine for my yard and I figured it would take up less space and be slightly more maneuverable than the 18\".

They responded quickly but much to my dismay, they send me a cheaper version of this hose.  They said they were out of the Flexi Hose so they sent me the Rocket hose, which is much cheaper to buy.  The difference in quality between the two is very obvious.  The Rocket hose itself feels like different material than the Flexi Hose.  The Rocket has no brass couplings;  theyre cheap metal.  The seller assured me the Rocket also has a lifetime warranty but we will see.  I would not buy another one of these because chances are it will not last and for $80, for it to last only 2 years is not acceptable.  I bought mine for $60+ here on Amazon and 2021 and now its $80 - steep increase for a hose that did not last.\""

Arm & Hammer Odor Busterz fit no problem and reduce odor A LOT (I also have room for a couple activated carbon pouches).  Litter: Weve tried the following scoopables: Arm and Hammer multicat, Tiny Cat Scoopable, Scoop Away, and Fresh Step.  Use a QUALITY scoopable/clumping litter, and you wont have issues.\", \"Weve had it around 9 months now (Purchased from another website), and we couldnt be happier. Weve tried a few of the other automatic litter boxes on the market, and none of them worked reliably longer than a couple of days without needing to be fixed constantly.  This specific litter box lives in a part of the house we dont go very often, but the cats do, so we need it to be self reliant (out of sight out of mind). It does just that.  My phone buzzes when theres a problem with the box (two cats use it as their primary box) which is about every 7 days or so.  They fill up the drawer within 2 weeks and I have to change the bag (I use standard drawstring kitchen trash bags instead of the proprietary liners no problem). About 1 week in, it says the tray is full, but if I just shake the tray in and out, it will flatten out the poop mound and last another week before needing to be dumped for reals.\", \"This litter box works so reliably.  Weve tried allllll the gimmicky boxes out there, like the one that flushes into your toilet, the rockin roller, the lever actuated ones, etc.  We were looking at Litter Robot, but it just felt like it had too many downsides compared to the Loo Too.  Its very quiet too I measured it at 38 decibels at 3 feet while it was cleaning, which is barely above the noise floor in our urban environment.  I could easily sleep with that if it was on the other side of our bedroom, so we might replace our other boxes with Loo Twos if we can figure out a way to get our girl, born with that defect that gives her shorter legs, to use it. Smarty Pear or Casa Leo or whatever they call themselves now would do well to sell a snap in step that replaces the little rubber insert for the step that gives more of a protruding platform for the cats to sit.\", \"The weight sensors never worked properly though.  All of my cats are between 7.5lbs and 8.5lbs, yet it says they weigh anywhere between 2.8lbs and 7.4lbs.  Luckily I dont care about this function. I have them trained to sit on a scale for weekly weigh ins to monitor their weight (one of them has chronic health problems so if we have to monitor her weight, why not the other two?). If youre buying this for the weighing feature, dont.  Buy it because it reliably scoops the litter EACH AND EVERY TIME.  Sometimes theres small poops that sneak back through the grate, but we do a full dump out of the litter every few months and that gets rid of them.\", \"Two of our three cats prefer this litter box over all of the others, and one of them will not use it.  The tiny step is in such a place that she just cant get up inside without committing to a big jump, and shes gotten careful in her old age.  She needs a bigger platform to stand on, so Ill probably 3d print one and see if that will work. Leos Loo should sell an extended step for sure!\", \"Odor: This is by far our best smelling/least smelling litter box.  We put Arm & Hammer Odor Busterz balls in the drawer in the air freshner spot with a couple activated carbon pouches (bought off rando Amazon sellers), and it just YOINKS the odor. This box lives very close to our front door, and we asked some random guests if they could smell cat litter. They said no.  We had a friend actually ask us one of the times where our litterboxes were because she has a hyper sensitive sense of smell and she was shocked she hadnt smelled them after being at our house for 3 hours.  We showed her where we hid the Leos Lou and she was shocked she was standing a few feet away and couldnt smell it. The UV light in the litter box is a proper unit, not just a few LEDS.  Its some kind of gas bulb with a proper ballast, so it must actually be doing something. I notice way less funk smell from this unit. The only smell I occasionally get is that ammonia smell when the drawer is VERY full.\", \"The app is... ok I  suppose?  I wish notifications had more granulate configuration.  Like I just want notifications when there is a problem, not every single time a cat uses it.  Sometimes theyll go in and out 2-3 times an hour just to inspect/dig, so the notifications become a nuisance.  Really that and the weight being off are my only two gripes, so its not even worth docking a star.  I consider the app to not be a core part of the function of the machine.\", Support/Warranty:, \"I recently had a flood in the room I keep this box  that resulted in 1-2 inches of water pooling up in the box.  This was due to a freak plumbing accident, not the box itself.  I let it dry out in the garage partially disassembled, but when I tried it out, it would not finish a cleaning cycle and was flashing lights.  I contact support, explained to them my whole issue, and asked if I could BUY replacement electronics for the litterbox. They not only agreed to let me replace the electronics myself (simple cables that plug into a PCB board), but they sent them to me free of charge under warranty EVEN THOUGH IT WASNT A DEFECT!!  I can name the times thats happened with other companies on a few fingers. Thats a very pro-consumer move, and Im very happy about it. I kept a giant chunk of plastic out of the landfill.\", \"All in all, Im at like a 9.5-9.75/10 on the Leos Loo Too.  For context, I give the Rockin Roller a 7/10, the Catit SmartSift a 4/10 (It broke a couple weeks in, but I was able to fix it with $2 of epoxy putty), the Cat Genie a 6/10, and the PetSafe ScoopFree a 6/10 (Clogged frequently and needed intervention).  Letting consumers have choice in how they want to use their products is important to me. This company does that, and lets the consumer do their own repairs! #righttorepair\""

Cleans much better (my opinion) than those square rake style boxes that get clogged all the time or the little flimsy container cracks and spilled used litter out., 3. Because it is lower to the ground than other similar products, it easier for my older cat to get in and out.  He can pretty much walk into it rather than having to jump.

I must say, this electric dethatcher has exceeded my expectations. I have purchased other brands in the past and have been left with disappointment. This dethatcher has made my lawn transformation an an absolute breeze., \"First and foremost, the 15 Amp motor is powerful enough to handle even the toughest thatch and debris, leaving my lawn looking beautifully groomed and ready for new grass seed. The 16-inch width of the dethatcher provides excellent coverage, allowing me to complete the task in less time compared to other models Ive used in the past.\", One of the standout features of this dethatcher is its user-friendly design. The adjustable depth settings make it incredibly versatile, catering to various types of lawns and which allowed me to customize the dethatching depth to meet my specific needs for debris removal. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to grip, and the machine is lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around my yard without feeling fatigued., \"I also appreciate the durable construction of the Rock&Rocker dethatcher. It feels robust and built to last, ensuring that Ill be able to enjoy its benefits for years to come. Additionally, the maintenance requirements are minimal, saving me valuable time and effort.\", \"What sets the Rock&Rocker 16-Inch 15 Amp Electric Dethatcher apart is its efficient performance. It effectively removes thatch and debris, promoting better nutrient absorption, water penetration, and overall lawn health. Ive used this at my parents house also with their Bermuda lawn and have noticed a significant improvement in the thickness and lushness of their lawn since I used this dethatcher. (With the proper care and water after of course.)\", Overall, I highly recommend the Rock&Rocker 16-Inch 15 Amp Electric Dethatcher to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient lawn maintenance tool. Its powerful motor, adjustable settings, user-friendly design, and excellent performance make it a fantastic investment for achieving a healthy and beautiful lawn."

I wanted something to make my job easier because I detest doing cat litter and I absolutely hate walking into my house and having it smell because the cat litter has not been done.  My older daughter who has cats also told me about what she had purchased and it was a self-cleaning cat litter box.  She said she purchased it because when she was pregnant you are not supposed to clean the kitty litter, so this helped her and her husband out.  She and her husband loved it, so she suggested we purchased one as well and I\u2019m glad she suggested it!!, HOLY MOLY this self-cleaning cat litter box is a state-of-the-art device designed to automate the process of removing waste from the litter box. It uses advanced technology to detect and remove clumps automatically, leaving a fresh and clean litter bed for the cats in our household., Setting up the self-cleaning litter box was surprisingly straightforward. The package included clear instructions, and within just a little bit, I had it ready for the cats to explore. I am not techno-smart at all and it was a pretty simple process for me, which is exactly what I like and need., One of the standout features of this self-cleaning litter box is its ability to detect and remove waste automatically. The kitty litter box is equipped with sensors that detect when a cat enters and exits the litter box. After a set delay, the mechanism activates and rakes through the litter, separating clumps from clean litter. The waste is then deposited into a sealed compartment, ensuring odor containment.  I mean how cool is that!!  I don\u2019t have to scoop the poop out anymore \u2013 I LOVE IT!!  I really don\u2019t know who invented this, but it is so worth the price.  If I don\u2019t have to scoop the poop, it is so worth the money., The other thing I really wanted is odor control.  If I was going to pay this much for a kitty litter box, it was a crucial factor that it has some darn good odor control!! I hated and I mean hated walking in my house and smelling cat litter.  It was embarrassing, especially if someone dropped by expectantly.  I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of this self-cleaning model. The sealed waste compartment and the regular removal of clumps significantly reduced odors in my home. Additionally, the litter box came with an ozone deodorizing technology, which works by neutralizing and eliminating any unpleasant smells, and let\u2019s face it, cat poo is not a pleasant smell., While the primary purpose of this litter box is self-cleaning, some maintenance is still required. The waste compartment needs to be emptied regularly, and the litter box itself should be cleaned and sanitized periodically. However, compared to traditional litter boxes, the maintenance involved with this self-cleaning model is significantly reduced. With our two cats I will say we will probably need to empty the waste compartment every 7 \u2013 10 days.  The description says for one cat every 15 days, but we have 2 cats and they are inside/outside cats.  So even though we have 2 cats, they do spend some time outside, so they do not use the litter box all the time.  But I love how easy it is when you do need to empty the waste compartment, you just change the liner, again, no scooping poop, the kitty litter box has already done this job for you!!!, When searching for a self-cleaning litter box, one potential concern I read over and over is the noise they generate. I was pleased to find that this one operated relatively quietly. The mechanical raking sound was not overly disruptive, and it did not seem to bother my cats either.  I guess time will tell to see if it continues to be this quiet, but so far it is really quiet and I\u2019m glad because otherwise it might scare the cats and then they would be hesitant to use it and then my money would be wasted and that would be upsetting., Oh, another thing I would like to mention.  While I was researching and looking for a self-cleaning litter box.  I researched the kind of kitty litter it would use.  My daughter\u2019s litter box uses special litter, so when she runs out she has to order it.  I wanted one that could use any type of litter.  I did not want one that had to use special littler.  This self-cleaning litter box will use any type of kitty litter as long as it is the clumping kind.  We have always purchased the clumping kind of litter so that works perfect for us!!, Last but not least and then I promise I will stop!!  But I am in love with this thing.  I keep telling all my coworkers and family about my new purchase.  I think they are all tired of me talking about my new kitty litter box, but I\u2019m so excited about it and that I don\u2019t have to scoop poop anymore.  BUT, you can also control the self-cleaning kitty litter box with your PHONE!!  You upload the app and connect the litter box to the WiFi (just not to 5g) and there you go!!  You can even track how many times your can is going potty.  I know it\u2019s silly, but I think that is pretty cool.  Anyhow, I think this is probably one of the longest reviews I have ever written, but I am just so excited about this litter box.  My cats seem to like it as well.  I love that my bathroom, where we have the litter box does not smell anymore (well like cat litter anyhow) I love that I don\u2019t have to scoop cat poop anymore and I\u2019m just so excited that I finally spent the money and ordered one of these kitty litter boxes., \"If you are at all like me and are even hesitating about investing in one of these because of the cost, please know that investing in a self-cleaning cat litter box has been a game-changer for me. The convenience, cleanliness, and odor control provided by this kitty litter box have made a noticeable difference in my life as a cat owner (ok they are actually my children\u2019s cats, but since I take care of them I claim them) And like I said in my review above while there is some minimal maintenance involved, the benefits far outweigh the extra effort. If youre like me and you are tired of dealing with the chore of manually cleaning the litter box daily and the odor that comes along with a regular cat litter box. I highly recommend considering a self-cleaning cat litter box. Its a worthwhile investment that will make both you and your fur-babies happy.  As you can tell, I highly recommend this product!!\""

I fixed that leak but only many tries and quite frankly in the processes gave up and decided it was time to replace it.  But then tried again and fixed the old one.  But for how long?  Who knows., This one is almost exactly the same except for the never-flat pump and auto inflate/deflate pump which is awesome.  Only trouble is it inflates to a far too stiff and firm matress then I prefer, even on the \"plush\" setting.  That's easily fixed because I can just deflate to my taste, which is not likely anyone else's preference.  But no big deal.  But that means I can't use the maintainer never-flat feature.  That would mean the maintainer pump would run until it reached the \"plush\" setting firmness what was already too firm for me., \"The other issue is, that maintainer never-flat pump is NOT silent.  Its loud enough to disturb me and people say I can sleep thru anything.  Thats true but I guess it depends on what the sound is.  The sound of that pump is a distraction from sleep to me.  Perhaps if I was already asleep it wouldnt bother me, IDK.  But even so as I said above, it would pump the bed up to past what firmness I like, even at the softest setting.\", Where I think the never-flat pump will come to be valuable to me is when the mattress ages and leaks more.  All airbeds do leak, it's inevitable.  Some minor through the material leaks with age will which are coming with use, will therefore be no so much of an issue.  The never-flat feature will kick in.  It remains for me to see if that pump will annoy me enough to wake me from a sound sleep.  Of if it will annoy guests using it or not.  But it's not \"silent\".  Know that.  Loud enough to matter?  Depends on who you are because me, a sound sleeper, it did keep me from falling asleep., \"But good news, you can turn of the never-flat pump.  And for the price that option, used of not, isnt costing much if at all extra.\", \"Update Mar 2023.  Only 4 months of careful use and the material split developing a hole and I had to patch it.

I realize this sounds insane and like no one would just keep popping their patella back into place every time it goes out for 21 years, never seeking further medical attention for the issue, especially as it continued to happen with increasing frequency. Its now at the point where it pops out at least once every month or two. Well, I have never claimed to be sane, and in my defense, the doctor I saw for the original injury said that I dislocated it so hard that it left permanent grooves in the cartilage underneath, and because of that, they would act as tracks and it would just keep dislocating, but there was nothing to be done for it. If you are wondering why I didnt seek a second opinion, its because he was the second opinion...\", \"Anyway, on to the brace... My knee has finally gotten so bad that I cant let it go any longer and am going to see an orthopedist again. Im pretty sure the soft tissue is so damaged that its virtually useless. I have tried almost every style of brace on the market (except the really expensive ones), and none of them have offered enough support in the right places and been comfortable to wear for any period of time... But then I found THIS brace!! I hadnt even realized how much pain my knee was constantly in until I put this brace on!\", 1) The inner silky sleeve which protects your leg from rubbing on the outer fabric, and is also breathable and moisture wicking is a complete game changer! One would think such a small detail would be insignificant, but in terms of comfort and wearability it makes all the difference in the world!, 2) The outer fabric is thinner and more light weight than most neoprene braces, making it more slim and comfortable, while still providing good compression and support. Also, the entire outside can be used to stick the velcro to, thus allowing you to position the straps exactly where you need them to be for optimal support., 3) The 2 extra patella support bands are AMAZING!!! They work far better than I ever could have imagined at keeping everything in alignment, and applying just enough pressure to give stability and relieve pain, without being too tight or uncomfortable, as they are fully adjustable., \"4) The side supports are great! They definitely offer necessary added stability. The brace does limit your range of motion some, but thats really the whole point of a brace, since too great of movements will only lead to further injury and damage of an already weak or hurt area.\", \"Hands down, this the the absolute best brace ever!!! The price isnt much higher than your generic designs, and it is well worth it! (Also, I visited the retailers store and received a 25% off coupon to use on Amazon for any of their products, so that was helpful). But even at full price its worth it. No other brace is designed quite as well, or offers the special features this one does. Plus, it is from a small business in the UK, designed by a guy determined to make a brace which would assist him with his own knee problems. The thought and care that went into making it is really evident, from construction to fit and function. It also comes with a 12 month warranty, and they send a paper with their contact info encouraging anyone who has an issue for any reason to contact them for resolution. They seem to be a good company who truly cares about their products and helping people. I very highly recommend that anyone with knee issues get this brace.\", \"The only suggestion I would make is for them to also make this in a plus sized version. Last year a medication I was put on caused A LOT of very rapid weight gain. Happily, stopping the med has reversed the process. But, had I tried to get this brace last year, it would not have fit my leg. Heavier people tend to have more joint problems, but there is a serious lack of good, affordable plus sized options of braces. I strongly encourage this company to fill that need. I am going to write to them regarding this issue. If you get this brace, or if you are a plus sized person whom this brace will not fit, I suggest that you also write to the company regarding this issue. Im sure if enough people do it they will see there is a need and will work to fill it.\", Thank you for reading my long winded review. I hope you found it to be helpful., \"Once more for good measure... BUY THIS BRACE!!! (you wont regret it).\", Namaste."

I bought the self-propelling version thinking I would need it most of the time as was the case with my gas-powered brush mower, a powerful, heavy beast.  But not so with the EGO!  On even gently uphill grades I push it just fine.  I only use the self-propel feature for 10-15% of the time. (Pushing also gives me good aerobic exercise without the cost, time, and air pollution to drive 10 miles to the nearest gym.  Just sayin\u2019.), \"This mowers design is so intuitive you don\u2019t need to read the manual to understand the controls - but the manual is also well written and full of good tips.  Read it.  A simple dead-man lever controls the power.  It\u2019s super easy to adjust the cutting height.  The self-propulsion is activated with just a thumb-push from one hand, and there\u2019s a dial to adjust the forward speed too.  I can work around tight corners by controlling and steering from the side, then fall in behind when the way is clear.\", The seven positions for the cutting height give superb flexibility from low to high cutting positions with a simple hand move.  If the grass grows too high too fast I just cut a notch higher. The motor will stop if the grass is too dense for the mower, to avoid overheating.  If that happens, I just move the cutting height a notch higher and resume mowing., Battery charge is good for \u201cup to\u201d 80 minutes of \u201clight duty use\u201d. I get more like 60 minutes, but I am using the self-propel feature for 10%-15% of the time and its spring now when the grass grows too tall way too fast. Maybe in August I\u2019ll get 80 minutes as the growth rate slows and I\u2019m clipping less than an inch instead of 2+ or more.  I used to mow my acre+ yard in 3 hours with the gas beast.  Now it me takes three one-hour sessions with breaks between sessions to recharge the battery. I just do something else for an hour while the battery charges.  The alternative would be to buy a second battery for $200 and recharge one while using the other., I found that using this mower turns out to be more about finesse than power.  It doesn\u2019t bull through deep grass like a heavy gas mower.  Adjust the height, or go slower.  Like the manual says.  Don\u2019t mow wet grass.  Like the manual says.  Those conditions tend to clog the blade housing.  If your style is to bull ahead against all obstacles, you must learn a new way.  The circuit breaker will protect the electric motor from your bullheadedness every time.  Learn to work with the tool and you\u2019ll be a better person.  Clean out the housing after every mowing.  Like the manual says. And listen to the mower subtly changing sounds as the load varies.  That can tell you when it\u2019s about to shut off due to heavy load. Listen, learn, and enjoy zen-like harmony with your new instrument."

It is the best value with the backlighting and rbg around the frame. Everything works as expected. The bottom has very grippy rubber tabs. Overall its a higher value board sold for much less of its value. Hopefully it holds up after long term use., \" The only flaw is the wrist rest. When placing the weight of your arm on end of the rest it will cause the keyboard to tilt upward. Ive fixed this with a thin gel pad under the wrist rest. The edge of the wrist rest is bevelled and resting your wrist at the edge for large hands turns the bevelled edge into a pivot point. Which is why the mini keyboard will flip upward or raise up. This area should be redesigned or a stick on rubber pad should be given to fix this issue!\", \"I use this as an extra keyboard on my desk for flight sims. Its nice to move all my extra plane controls onto a dedicated keyboard that takes up less space while my big board is moved aside. It is also much cheaper to buy this instead of dedicated flight gear offering many times less buttons for a much higher premium. For my end use this is a good value product. For a gamer wanting a mini board this will work fine. Ive had no ghosting or delayed response issues. Plus the board is brightly lit making it great for dark room settings.

This hose comes with a bonus 10-way spray nozzle and is designed for both commercial and residential use.\", Durability and Build Quality: The hose itself appears quite durable. The stainless steel construction with a fabric skin suggests a robust design capable of withstanding regular use in a variety of outdoor conditions., Ease of Use and Connections: One of the key features I appreciate is the ease of use, especially regarding the connections. They are straightforward to handle, attaching smoothly without binding or coming loose unintentionally. This ease of connection is crucial for frequent use in a garden or farm setting., \"Longevity: While I havent had the hose for a long time, its solid construction gives me confidence in its potential for long-term use. The quality of materials and build suggest it will be a lasting tool for my gardening and farming needs.\", \"Spray Nozzle Quality: The included 10-way spray nozzle, however, feels a bit cheap and does not seem to match the quality of the hose. It doesnt give the impression of being a durable component of the set.\", Overall, the PowerFlow Garden Hose seems like a solid product for various gardening and farming tasks. Its sturdy construction, combined with easy-to-use connections, make it a practical choice. While the quality of the included sprayer might be a slight letdown, the hose itself appears to be reliable and well-suited for both residential and commercial use."

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: grass collection of walk-behind-lawn-mowers\nReview text: Purchased in March 2019 at HD.  Was lazy about getting around to writing a 5-star review singing its praises, but here's a 2-star, now that it's suddenly dead in the water.  Used twice a month until recently the motor/blade would only do one turn and then freeze when starting.  Tried looking under the hood but this \"Type 2\" version is a bit more complicated than the \"Type 1\" MM2000 and the MM850 I used for over 20 years. The \"Type 2\" has an offset belt-drive motor. The older units had direct-drive setups where the only items that ever went bad were switches or DC rectifiers and I could do an easy repair.  I messaged B+D online support as to what the problem could be, but never got a response., PROs:, Very light weight and easy to control for a \"full size\" (>=19\") mower. Only 43 pounds. That's primarily due to the plastic deck, which gets criticized for not being as durable as steel, but a steel deck would be ten pounds more to push around.  Yes, there is the picture here in the reviews of a hole shot through the deck by a stone, but hopefully that's a rare occurrence.  Just avoid rough-riding it around rocks and stumps and you should be okay. The \"EdgeMax\" feature is a little gimmicky, but it does help visually line up the mower when moving along walls and borders., CONs:, The power cord strain-relief attachment needs to be bigger and beefier to handle a 12AWG cord. It seems woefully small and the sharp edges would cut into the insulation of anything thicker than 16AWG.  Rather than trying to thread my 12AWG through it as designed, my work-around was to wrap a square a knot around it, then thread a Velcro cinch-strap through it all to hold it together., \"They should consider changing the plug to a three-prong grounded, even though grounding isnt really necessary. They extra prong would provide extra friction to hold the connection together. That, plus two-prong cords in a heavy enough gauge to run the machine comfortably just arent available.\", \"For some reason the grass catching bag was made with both a fabric bottom layer on the inside, and a solid plastic layer on the outside. Dust and dirt end up passing through the fabric and trapped by the plastic. Eventually you have five pounds of stuff in the bag that cant be emptied. May have to cut a strategically placed opening somewhere to get all it all out.\", TIPs:, \"If you can afford it, go with a 12 AWG power cord, just long enough to reach all the corners of your lawn. Your mowers motor will thank you for it with better performance and possibly longer life.  If you need longer than 100 feet, youre a candidate for a battery powered model.\", \"Every 1 or 2 years, remove the plastic top cover and use a leaf blower to clear out dust and debris from around the motor. The interior cant be sealed because air needs to circulate to cool the motor, and a surprising amount of stuff collects in there.\", Closing Thoughts:, When you've seen enough of these electric mowers, you're left with the impression that they all come out one or two factories in Asia, just with different colors and styling depending on the brand.  Repair or replace ? It's probably cheaper to just buy a new one than sending it out to a service center, but it really annoys me that the carcasses of all these mowers are ending up in landfills. (most recyclers don't consider them \"electronic waste\").  If durability is no longer going to be a priority for the manufacturers, my recommendation is don't purchase until you've researched what brand is likely to provide the best aftermarket service and support. Considering Ryobi RYAC200 or Greenworks 25112 as replacements, but not another B+D."

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: wrist rest of pc-gaming-keyboards\nReview text:   I am a programmer by trade and use computers basically all day every day and have done so for the better part of 15 years now. Due to my profession; I am somewhat of an \"expert\" on keyboards and have tried very many keyboards. Since joining this product testing program here on amazon I have tested at least 10 more keyboards with different kinds of switches and such., \"Now onto this keyboard; This is the first time I use these Logitech GL switches (they are brand new). My best way to describe this in a single sentence is that they feel similar to laptops with high end chicklet keyboards. They have a low profile combined with high key stability and smooth key actuation. There is definitely less pressure / force required for a key actuation vs my daily cherry brown keyboard (also Logitech and in the first picture).\", \"However laptops dont have this much travel (which is very similar to other low profile keyboards, especially those basic dell low profile membrane keyboards) and they dont have partial press key activation like mechanical keys. These Logitech GL (tactical) keys have a shorter key travel vs a normal cherry brown key; these keys actuate at 1.5mm and have 2.7mm full travel where regular cherry brown (tactile) keys have 2.0mm activation and 4mm travel. The activation force is also 50gf vs 55gf on a cherry brown.\", For someone like myself who types a ton every day; this actually translated into a better typing experience. In some cases I was able to type faster; due to the lower key actuation points and smoother keystrokes. However the lack of a wrist-rest causes more strain on my wrists at certain angles. Considering they put all the time into engineering these light faster keys; they should have also built a wrist rest to make this truly a complete package. As it is right now there is no wrist rest that is designed for these keyboards and because of their low profile design; there is no wrist rest that works properly with it., Connectivity is great and variable; I've never had a keyboard with so many connectivity options. I suppose this can make the keyboard flexible to be \"portable\" as well as just your home keyboard. There are buttons on the keyboard which switch from lightspeed wireless to bluetooth; meaning that 2 devices can be connected at once. I tried this out by pairing the keyboard with a laptop in my office and using the lightspeed adapter on my desktop. Therefore I just pressed a key and I could switch between both devices... this is something I haven't experienced before and it might be worth the additional price you pay for these wireless keyboards if multiple devices is something you use frequently. I also tried out the keyboard in a wired fashion; when plugged in via micro USB (disappointing to not see USB-C at this price point) it will connect directly to the machine (if plugged into a computer USB port)., Since I already use Logitech devices on my machine; I paired it with my G-Hub and setup the color wave and sleep times. This lets the keyboard go to sleep when I am not at the PC. Using this method in about 10 days of on and off usage I only lost around 20% battery life.... this means though that on weeks where I sit at my PC for the whole week I would likely have to charge the keyboard at least once in the week. This is a major downside for someone like me who usually uses their desktop. I can't knock off a star for this though since I can just connect the keyboard directly via MicroUSB (cable included in box) and never worry about charging a battery. For the interest of this review though I wanted the full \"wireless experience\"., \"Typing on bluetooth also showed basically 0 lag (although with the laptop it was clear to have a bit more delay vs the desktop with the lightspeed connector) even when over bluetooth. I tried a bit of gaming as well (I unfortunately dont have time to play many games these days) and performance was perfect just as it is on my everyday keyboard. The slightly quicker actuation on this keyboard could be beneficial over time with the proper training.\", \"My biggest personal gripe with this keyboard is actually the fact that its TKL; I really dont like TKL keyboards but that is my own personal need. Logitech does sell one that isnt TKL so that is my own personal preference vs the fault of this keyboard.\", I went into the usage of this keyboard with the expectation that the experience would be inferior to that of my Cherry MX Logitech keyboard. In the past I have found non-cherry switches to lack in consistency and key stability. However I was pleasantly surprised with this keyboard and it has made me a fan. Logitech really has done a good job here designing an all new key that dare I say it; could be actually better than the original Cherry brown design that many have loved for over a decade now!, I really wish I could use this for every day but I just cannot deal with having a TKL so the fate of this keyboard is unknown post this review. Possibly I will keep it for times when I travel and pair it to my laptop. Really great work done on this keyboard overall! If you are looking for a great all-around keyboard then definitely check out this lineup (both TKL and full-size)., Edit:, I have also tested the Linear version now and I have to say that I like it better than the tactile version in its current state. The low profile nature of the keycaps eliminates the need for a tactile bump since you can easily bottom them out or even half press with enough \"feedback\". Therefore I don't have the same problem as with a linear full size keyboard where most typists such as myself have issues with double press or mis-typing., If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!"

It is a longer brace style that gives great structural support to my LCL. The adjustable support bands give a custom fit all around. I don\u2019t get the same gaps and bunches I have experienced with other braces and I don\u2019t need to pull up a slipping brace all day. This one stays perfectly in place every single time. It is very supportive but flexible and allows me a good range of motion as my post-injury activity tolerance has increased. I\u2019ve been using it for the past 3 weeks at work which includes a daily average of walking 3-4miles throughout our building.

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: maintenance of walk-behind-lawn-mowers\nReview text: Purchased in March 2019 at HD.  Was lazy about getting around to writing a 5-star review singing its praises, but here's a 2-star, now that it's suddenly dead in the water.  Used twice a month until recently the motor/blade would only do one turn and then freeze when starting.  Tried looking under the hood but this \"Type 2\" version is a bit more complicated than the \"Type 1\" MM2000 and the MM850 I used for over 20 years. The \"Type 2\" has an offset belt-drive motor. The older units had direct-drive setups where the only items that ever went bad were switches or DC rectifiers and I could do an easy repair.  I messaged B+D online support as to what the problem could be, but never got a response., PROs:, Very light weight and easy to control for a \"full size\" (>=19\") mower. Only 43 pounds. That's primarily due to the plastic deck, which gets criticized for not being as durable as steel, but a steel deck would be ten pounds more to push around.  Yes, there is the picture here in the reviews of a hole shot through the deck by a stone, but hopefully that's a rare occurrence.  Just avoid rough-riding it around rocks and stumps and you should be okay. The \"EdgeMax\" feature is a little gimmicky, but it does help visually line up the mower when moving along walls and borders., CONs:, The power cord strain-relief attachment needs to be bigger and beefier to handle a 12AWG cord. It seems woefully small and the sharp edges would cut into the insulation of anything thicker than 16AWG.  Rather than trying to thread my 12AWG through it as designed, my work-around was to wrap a square a knot around it, then thread a Velcro cinch-strap through it all to hold it together., \"They should consider changing the plug to a three-prong grounded, even though grounding isnt really necessary. They extra prong would provide extra friction to hold the connection together. That, plus two-prong cords in a heavy enough gauge to run the machine comfortably just arent available.\", \"For some reason the grass catching bag was made with both a fabric bottom layer on the inside, and a solid plastic layer on the outside. Dust and dirt end up passing through the fabric and trapped by the plastic. Eventually you have five pounds of stuff in the bag that cant be emptied. May have to cut a strategically placed opening somewhere to get all it all out.\", TIPs:, \"If you can afford it, go with a 12 AWG power cord, just long enough to reach all the corners of your lawn. Your mowers motor will thank you for it with better performance and possibly longer life.  If you need longer than 100 feet, youre a candidate for a battery powered model.\", \"Every 1 or 2 years, remove the plastic top cover and use a leaf blower to clear out dust and debris from around the motor. The interior cant be sealed because air needs to circulate to cool the motor, and a surprising amount of stuff collects in there.\", Closing Thoughts:, When you've seen enough of these electric mowers, you're left with the impression that they all come out one or two factories in Asia, just with different colors and styling depending on the brand.  Repair or replace ? It's probably cheaper to just buy a new one than sending it out to a service center, but it really annoys me that the carcasses of all these mowers are ending up in landfills. (most recyclers don't consider them \"electronic waste\").  If durability is no longer going to be a priority for the manufacturers, my recommendation is don't purchase until you've researched what brand is likely to provide the best aftermarket service and support. Considering Ryobi RYAC200 or Greenworks 25112 as replacements, but not another B+D."

The instruction manual solved the \"translation\" problem by simplifying to the point of basically saying \"assemble the handle\".  Unfortunately the design is pretty poor so although it's \"easy\" to assemble it also is \"hard\"., Actual grass cutting seems to work well (at least now while it is brand new) but it \"clogs\" up fairly quickly which motivates you to stop and clear it so it will run better.

Well they really are a custom fit! They look like original leather seats and the quality is really soft and great! I know someone in another review mentioned theirs did not come with the cutouts for back seat reclining handles but mine did and I provided a photo. One of my issues with these is the texture against clothing! I can\u2019t just slide in and out of my car like in a normal leather seated car because your clothes stick and will tug the seat covers and makes them shift and I have to keep adjusting them back to place and some of the hooks under the seats keep coming undone and I have to hook them again. Also the seat covers come in 2 pieces, one for the back rest and one for seat and they don\u2019t really meet or over lap so if I were to accidentally spill a liquid on the seat it will spill towards the back where the back rest and seat meet and soak into your cloth seats underneath (also provided pic of the gap for reference). I also included a video of how to access the back seat cup holder. Overall I think these are great seat covers for my car and my needs. I am leaving a detailed review that I would\u2019ve liked to see when looking for seat covers so you can make a decision about these before purchasing. $250 is a little steep but cheaper than having to pay a detailer to shampoo your seats in the future and to keep buying those crappy covers from auto stores that never fit right and rip easily. I would give 5 stars but the tugging with my clothing is annoying that I have to practically hop into and out of the car. I will try a leather lotion and see if that helps\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd'u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

The build quality is great, well above what youd expect at this price point. Im a taller guy so I didnt find the wrist guard to be very helpful (it doesnt extend very far beyond the keys) but the keyboard is comfortable enough without it. Keys feel strong, not loud, with enough bounciness to make me recognize it will likely handle plenty of wear and tear.\", The lights were suppose to be just a fun little perk on top, but they're actually quite beautiful, not too bright (I can have it on in my room with almost no lights on it and doesn't blind me) and they help illuminate the keys if you ever get lost on the home row (which has happened fairly often since this keyboard elevates the keys differently than my old one). I would highly recommend this as a very capable \"basic\" keyboard that feels/looks more expensive than it is."

This hose is marketed as flexible, durable, kink-free, lightweight, and ideal for uses like garden watering and car washes., Durability and Build Quality: The hose seems to be of average durability. While I have only used it for a short period, its construction gives the impression of a solidly built product that could withstand regular use in a gardening environment., Ease of Use and Connections: The hose features easy-to-use connections that attach smoothly without binding or coming loose. This ease of connection is essential for practical and efficient use in a farm or garden setting., Longevity: As I have only used the hose briefly, I cannot fully comment on its long-term durability. However, based on my initial impressions, it seems like a product that could potentially offer a decent lifespan with regular use., Water Flow and Interior Diameter: One notable drawback is the internal hose diameter, which is approximately 3/8 of an inch when unfolded. This smaller diameter limits water flow, which could be a significant consideration for tasks requiring higher water volume. However, I was able to adapt it for my specific needs, which involved cutting it into shorter pieces for connecting multiple irrigation points., Compactness: Due to its smaller interior diameter, the hose has the advantage of being more compact when packed down. This feature can be beneficial for storage or when transporting the hose., Overall, the Ardurhm Garden Hose is a reasonably solid product for general garden and farm use. Its ease of use and average durability make it suitable for various outdoor tasks. However, the limitation in water flow due to its smaller internal diameter might be a critical factor for users requiring a hose for high-volume watering. Its compactness and flexibility are advantageous features, especially for those with storage or space constraints."

Also added comments on clicky vs tactile and will include my review on both, \"Went into this with a bit of trepidation because of the low-profile switches.  However, actually found it quite nice to type on.  Also purchased a Drop CTRL at the same time with Halo Trues, and while the feel is obviously totally different, I somewhat prefer the feel of the Logitech key profile and shorter travel.  To be fair, my last mechanical keyboard was a stash of IBM Model Ms that I got rid of almost a decade ago, and most of what Ive typed on since has been low-profile so I am more used to that now.  Since the key-spacing is still standard, the G915 shouldnt require a ton of adjustment for people used to full size keyboards.\", \"That said, this keyboard has some flaws, with the first one being the most significant to me - the secondary legends are not lit.  All the special character keys (like & and *) are simply printed on the keys and do not light.  Since the printing is not high contrast to begin with, this makes them exceptionally difficult to see in the dark.  I have no problem touch typing with the alpha keys, but will glance for the less frequently used special characters, and the lack of lighting is really annoying.  Its also a little confusing for keys where the secondary character is used more commonly than the primary (ex: double quotes, question mark, etc...).\", \"For reference, the lighter of the photos was taken with typical indoor lighting and while you can see the legends they dont exactly stand out.  Under dim lighting, much less with the lights out, theyre effectively invisible.  This is an especially glaring flaw given plenty of other keyboard manufacturers have figured out a simple solution to this - simply print the secondary legend alongside the primary instead of below it, and let them both light up.\", \"Second, this is 2020.  Why in the world did Logitech choose to go with micro-USB instead of USB-C?  Most other new model high end keyboards now have started adopting USB-C.  This was a common complaint on the original G915 as well (along with the lack of lit secondary legends), and its clear Logitech hasnt learned anything from all of the prior feedback.\", \"Third, while the battery life from the lithium battery is great, if Im spending $220 on a keyboard, I dont want to replace it in a few years if the battery starts losing its capacity.  How many of you have had cell phones or laptops that just dont hold a charge as long as they used to?  If you usually use this in wired mode that may be unlikely (since youre not constantly discharging the battery fully), but it would be better if the battery was replaceable.\", \" And, while I might be in the minority for saying so, Id almost rather it use rechargeable NiMH AAs (just throw a couple of Eneloops in it) than a non-replaceable lithium battery.\", \"Finally, I really wish Logitech had went with higher end keycaps.  On a $220 keyboard it isnt outrageous to hope for PBT double-shot keycaps.  While ABS keycaps arent uncommon, at this price point a lot of wired keyboards are now including PBT double-shot keycaps, which feel more solid, wont show oil shine, and wont have legends wearing out.  This and the lack of shine-through secondary legends would be less of an issue if you could replace the keycaps, but its virtually impossible to find third party keycaps in this profile (looks similar to Kailh Choc switches but I dont have a Kailh Choc board to try swapping with).  To be fair theres not a large number of mechanical wireless keyboards to begin with, and most of those are also still using ABS keycaps, so you may be stuck with this regardless (when the Keychron K8 eventually comes out, its keycaps will be ABS but are at least OEM profile and can be swapped out).\", \"Originally there were issues with the software, but Logitech fixed those with a software update made available on release day.  The new software does recognize the keyboard correctly and let you customize the lighting.  You can also adjust things like how long a period of inactivity before the lighting turns off.  Note that you also need the software to set a default lighting mode (for example, the board defaults to all keys lit the same color and gently rotates between colors - I prefer the color wave, but the board wont remember that without the software, and after inactivity defaults back to the original setting).\", \"As for the pluses... As I noted above, its quite comfortable (for me at least) to type on.  Ive apparently come to prefer the light actuation force and short key travel.  The Lightspeed wireless is responsive, simply works (just plug in the dongle - no issues with pairing), and doesnt interfere with my Bluetooth headset, which is a big plus.  If you can get past the unlit secondary legends, the primary legends are attractive and have a very pleasant glow.\", \"Build quality is good and the aluminum top panel is attractive and has a decent heft to it.  The bottom is plastic but seems solid and the keyboard doesnt feel like it has any worrisome flex to it.  The plastic tip-out feet do feel a bit cheap, though they still hold the keyboard without shaking.  At this price point wired keyboards are a lot more robust (the Drop CTRL I also purchased has an aluminum upper and lower, and the feet are also solid aluminum), but thats not really an apples-to-apples comparison.\", \"If youre looking at both the clicky and tactile versions of this keyboard, both felt good to me to type on.  However, the tactile response on the clicky is sharper and more noticeable.  With these low profile switches the tactile version has relatively little feedback when compared to full size tactile switches.  I cant compare it to the linear version, but If youre coming from a keyboard with a significant tactile response, the tactile version of this keyboard is definitely going to be more subtle in comparison.\", The clicky version technically clicks both on the downstroke and on the upstroke.  This isn't that noticeable and isn't at all off-putting.  The key does actuate before the click, but it is close enough that it is imperceptible and is unlikely to affect normal typing (to confirm it I had to push the key down as slowly as I possibly could).  The sound is definitely a \"click\", or \"tick\", not a \"clack\".  Subjectively the Kailh click bar based switches are reported to be a bit higher pitched but crisper than ones based on a click jacket design (like Cherry MX Blues).  The last clicky keyboard I owned was an IBM Model M, which isn't really a fair comparison, and this definitely doesn't scratch that itch for me.  However, as noted above, I found the click gave a slightly better tactile response than the non-clicky tactile version.  Alas, while the keyboard is not that loud, it was still a deal breaker for my wife., \"Unfortunately, the negatives really leave me on the fence with this keyboard.  The Drop CTRL I am also considering is better built, has better keycaps, swappable switches, USB-C, and open source firmware.  If I go with the G915 it will either be because I cant past having an extra wire on my desk (and right now the G915 is probably the best wireless option with backlit keys unless you want to take a chance on a Hexgears Venture) or because I find myself unable to adapt to full height keys anymore after using laptop keyboards for so long.\", If I had suggestions for Logitech:, * Lit secondary legends, * USB-C, * PBT keycaps, * User replaceable battery"

Each pump could only last for couple minutes before the bed started to feel uneven, and we need to pump at least twice a night to maintain the least level of comfort. When I tried to claim the warranty on INTEX website, I got the most rediculous request I have ever seen in my whole life. To submit the warranty claim and obtain the replacement, I have to first upload pictures showing I CUT HOLES on the airbed, multiple holes!! But what would my friend use when we wait for this I dont know what quality replacement bed which will take I dont know how long to get approved and shipped?? The lack of trust to its customers is just simply RIDICULOUS and I feel extremely insulted. I expressed my concern and explained that I could provide the picture of the holes once I receive the new bed, but the customer service just rejected my claim because I didnt send pictures they requested. Terrible communication. I wonder if this is their strategy to have the bed barely last for over 1 month so its passed the amazon return window, then disgust customers with such unreasonable request to avoid fulfilling the warranty.\", A follow up: the customer service ended up providing trouble shooting instructions in addition to the cut out replacement solution and appreciate that. Will try trouble shooting first."

At least, I was able to get the machine only as I already had a battery. The instructions werent clear that this mower is ready to go right out of the box. I was trying to figure out what I had to do to assemble it. Just had to insert the battery, open the handle into mowing position and telescope it out.\", It comes with the mulching blade installed. I was thinking I would want to use the flat extended use blade but I was not in a mood to change blades. Turns out the mulching blade ran for as long as I needed to mow my front lawn with my 4 year old battery. Indeed, I think the battery lasted a little longer than it had in the 2100SP. The mulching blade cut beautifully. My lawn looks great and does not have row lines, just a clean all over look., More importantly, this mower is lighter than the 2100SP and has better wheels. I was able to turn it with much less effort which is important to a 68 year old woman with lots of tree and shrub obstacles in my yard., My only gripe, EGO if your reading, is that I prefer the hand brake style propulsion control. I had better control with it and it was easier on my old hands. That said, I am actually happy that I had to get this mower."

Our grass was even wet a little and still mowed it like it was nothing. Even though the lights doesnt work on the battery to let me know how much charge I have left , it mows better than a gas mower I ever owned. I have a big yard. and it didnt even slow down a little bit. And our grass was 4 feet high in some areas. And it cut like a champ. Our grass was even wet a little and still mowed it like it was nothing. The single lever height adjustment is something I didnt consider that important when comparing alternatives, but something you really appreciate once you have it. The variable speed on the mower is really an awesome feature. When going through light grass you save energy, and when going through heavy grass it makes the mower not stall. The gasoline powered mower would stall almost every lap on the lower part of our property, where the grass seems to grow thicker. The electric mower has not stalled even once, ever. By the same token, starting the mower with a button instead of pulling the cord is a dream too.\",  Also the best thing is very super light weight\uff01\uff01think my vacuum is heavier than this mover\uff01Even if you are very thin, you can use it well., The overall all quality of the wheels, the deck and the handle are very high, again superior to the Poulan Pro.

I was skeptical about buying an electric mower because I let my grass get very high between mowings.  Frequently, I have to cut through 2 foot very thick grass where even my gas mower would stall.  I figured there was no way the electric mower would be as strong as my 6.25hp gas mower, but I gathered from reviews that it might be close, so I figured Id give it a shot.\", Well, I just used my new electric Ego mower for the first time, and let me just say that it not only met my expectations, it far exceeded them!!!  If you are in doubt, BUY THIS MOWER!!!  It is truly the Tesla of lawnmowers., \"I wanted to stress the mower to see its capability, so I let my grass get super tall -- knee height in many places.  I put the mower in mulch mode.  I put it at the very lowest height setting.  My gas mower would have struggled in these conditions.  And to my surprise, the Ego chopped through everything like butter!!!  It was truly phenomenal.  Im simply speechless...  Its that good!\", It was a breeze to start up.  The mulcher worked great.  The self-propelled worked great.  I put the speed at 1/3 and even that was a little fast for me.  The grass cut very evenly.  I had charged it to 75% before starting, and at the end of cutting my medium sized yard I had 25% battery remaining.  (I bought the one with the 7.5Ah battery.  In retrospect the 5Ah would have been sufficient.)  It was super smooth and did not vibrate as much as my gas mower did.  The handlebar height and angle is adjustable to accommodate a range of people., Now for some very minor gripes about an otherwise fantastic mower:, \"I couldnt see what my battery level was when I was mowing or when it was not plugged in.  Theres a button on the battery -- didnt do anything when I pressed it except turn green.  Theres also an LED on the mower with some indicator but impossible to read in the sun.  I had to plug it in the charger to see what level it was at.  I bet theres an easier way to do it -- I should probably read the manual!\", \"The speed and torque when using the self-propelled is just crazy.  Its seriously too much.  Sometimes I would try hold the mower in place to pause, but I couldnt because the thing is just so darn strong and it would keep going and take me with it.  At half speed I practically had to run to keep up with it.  Theres a lever to turn the self-propelled on and off, but it takes some gymnastics of the hand to use it.  I was starting to get the hang of it by the end of the session, but it seems like something that should be easier.  This made doing quick turns and stopping on a dime difficult.  Its difficult because the thing is just so darn powerful -- but thats much better than it being too weak!  Next time Im going to put it on the slowest setting.\", \"Also, the side chute discharge is hacky.  It doesnt really snap in place and relies on the flap sitting on top of it to hold it in place.  I was super annoyed by this at first, but after seeing how well the mulcher worked, I doubt Ill ever use the side chute.  The mulcher really is just that good.\", It's definitely more quiet than a gas mower, but it's not super quiet.  I just saw it says \"30% more quiet than a gas mower\" which seems about right.  I thought it would be even more quiet, but really I don't care.  I never plan to mow my lawn at night., Overall, would I buy this mower again given the chance?  Hands down, without hesitation, YES!!!  My days of gas mowers are officially over forever., \"Update: Today I chopped a bunch of branches and left them in piles in the yard.  I wanted to see if the mower could mulch them up.  This is where my old gas mower would have stalled all over the place.  Well, the ego mulched it no problem in one pass, and this was some really tough stuff.  I cant even tell my yard had giant stacks of branches earlier today!  This mower is not just as powerful as my old gas mower, its better!  Hands down, buy this mower!  You wont regret it.  Im really picky about stuff and I hate mowing lawns, and even I am in love with this thing.\""

We have tall fescue grass, and our yard is about 1000 sq ft. I am somewhat new at maintaining a yard and still learning. Ideally I\u2019d probably be cutting every 5-6 days, but with rain and work it doesn\u2019t always work out and is sometimes closer to 7-10 days., Pros, - I like the cover around the reel. It\u2019s metal and feels sturdy., - The mower pushes forward with minimal effort., - It cuts grass well enough., - This lawnmower stows nicely inside a garage and doesn\u2019t take up much space. The handle rotates forward far enough that I can rest it up against a wall with the reel cover facing outward, so the blades aren\u2019t really exposed., - I saw the other Fiskars reel mower in person (StaySharp Max) and thought this one was better and quieter. I don\u2019t think the additional features of the Max would make much difference, for example the slightly wider blade and the distance from the blade to the edge is probably isn\u2019t the biggest factor in cutting time. Especially since this one is less expensive, if you\u2019re looking for a manual reel mower, I would recommend this one., Cons, - I often have to go over grass several times to cut most of the blades, which takes time, especially on the higher length settings. Even then, there are still some blades that get missed. The grass blades have to make their way into the reel, so if any are growing tangential to the ground, or in some cases may be too long, the blades may not get cut. I haven\u2019t tried cutting my grass with a rotary mower yet to get an apples to apples comparison, and see if the suction generated by the rotary mower helps cut the blades this mower misses, but I suspect it would help., - Related to the first item, it seems like the reel doesn\u2019t spin fast enough, and as a result I need to make additional passes. The lawnmower is pretty easy to push, I would rather push a little harder if it meant the reel would spin faster., - I wish there was a quick release pin where I could lock the reel in place after I\u2019m done with it. As far as I can tell, there is no way to lock the reel when not in use, which isn\u2019t ideal. I\u2019ve had to lift the mower (using the handle) off the ground to get around items in my garage, and having the exposed blades makes me nervous. That said, I don\u2019t know if any reel mowers have this feature, not just this one, and this one does have the cover which helps., - The reel mower doesn\u2019t really mulch blades after being cut. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very noticeable aesthetically, but it may lead to a thicker layer of thatch. I don\u2019t know whether rotary mowers do a better job at mulching the cut blades., - The wheels are hard and there isn\u2019t any sort of suspension, so you feel and hear even the tiniest bumps constantly., - None of the four wheels swivel, so the mower doesn\u2019t turn right or left easily. I think this is an issue with a lot of mowers, not just this one, but in a smaller yard like mine, I have to make a lot of turns so it\u2019s an annoyance. I can hear grass being ripped if I try to turn without lifting the front two wheels off the ground., - I had heard an advantage to reel mowers vs rotary mowers is a cleaner cut of the blade. Right next to my yard, landscapers cut community grass with ride-on gas mowers. To me it\u2019s hard to tell a difference between the two methods of cutting. I\u2019d say that maybe the grass I cut with this mower looks better, but it\u2019s only slightly. It also may not be due to the rotary vs. reel mower differences., In summary, as far as reel mowers go, this one is pretty good. However if I was doing it again, I would consider a battery powered rotary mower. They\u2019re more expensive, require a little more storage space, and aren\u2019t manually powered (for better or worse), but if I can cut the grass faster and do a better job at cutting all the grass blades in fewer passes, it\u2019s probably worth the savings in time over the life of the mower. And if it leads me to cut grass more frequently, that may be overall healthier for the lawn than any reel vs. rotary mower cutting differences. There don\u2019t seem to be a great selection of powered reel mowers, so I didn\u2019t consider them. If you are ok with the drawbacks and/or want to save money, then this seems to be a pretty solid manual reel mower."

I realize this sounds insane and like no one would just keep popping their patella back into place every time it goes out for 21 years, never seeking further medical attention for the issue, especially as it continued to happen with increasing frequency. Its now at the point where it pops out at least once every month or two. Well, I have never claimed to be sane, and in my defense, the doctor I saw for the original injury said that I dislocated it so hard that it left permanent grooves in the cartilage underneath, and because of that, they would act as tracks and it would just keep dislocating, but there was nothing to be done for it. If you are wondering why I didnt seek a second opinion, its because he was the second opinion...\", \"Anyway, on to the brace... My knee has finally gotten so bad that I cant let it go any longer and am going to see an orthopedist again. Im pretty sure the soft tissue is so damaged that its virtually useless. I have tried almost every style of brace on the market (except the really expensive ones), and none of them have offered enough support in the right places and been comfortable to wear for any period of time... But then I found THIS brace!! I hadnt even realized how much pain my knee was constantly in until I put this brace on!\", 1) The inner silky sleeve which protects your leg from rubbing on the outer fabric, and is also breathable and moisture wicking is a complete game changer! One would think such a small detail would be insignificant, but in terms of comfort and wearability it makes all the difference in the world!, 2) The outer fabric is thinner and more light weight than most neoprene braces, making it more slim and comfortable, while still providing good compression and support. Also, the entire outside can be used to stick the velcro to, thus allowing you to position the straps exactly where you need them to be for optimal support., 3) The 2 extra patella support bands are AMAZING!!! They work far better than I ever could have imagined at keeping everything in alignment, and applying just enough pressure to give stability and relieve pain, without being too tight or uncomfortable, as they are fully adjustable., \"4) The side supports are great! They definitely offer necessary added stability. The brace does limit your range of motion some, but thats really the whole point of a brace, since too great of movements will only lead to further injury and damage of an already weak or hurt area.\", \"Hands down, this the the absolute best brace ever!!! The price isnt much higher than your generic designs, and it is well worth it! (Also, I visited the retailers store and received a 25% off coupon to use on Amazon for any of their products, so that was helpful). But even at full price its worth it. No other brace is designed quite as well, or offers the special features this one does. Plus, it is from a small business in the UK, designed by a guy determined to make a brace which would assist him with his own knee problems. The thought and care that went into making it is really evident, from construction to fit and function. It also comes with a 12 month warranty, and they send a paper with their contact info encouraging anyone who has an issue for any reason to contact them for resolution. They seem to be a good company who truly cares about their products and helping people. I very highly recommend that anyone with knee issues get this brace.\", \"The only suggestion I would make is for them to also make this in a plus sized version. Last year a medication I was put on caused A LOT of very rapid weight gain. Happily, stopping the med has reversed the process. But, had I tried to get this brace last year, it would not have fit my leg. Heavier people tend to have more joint problems, but there is a serious lack of good, affordable plus sized options of braces. I strongly encourage this company to fill that need. I am going to write to them regarding this issue. If you get this brace, or if you are a plus sized person whom this brace will not fit, I suggest that you also write to the company regarding this issue. Im sure if enough people do it they will see there is a need and will work to fill it.\", Thank you for reading my long winded review. I hope you found it to be helpful., \"Once more for good measure... BUY THIS BRACE!!! (you wont regret it).\", Namaste."

Fine-blade Royal Zoysia.), Verdict:  This is a miserable machine and performs terribly for a lawn mower. waste of money., The machine took almost two weeks to arrive. It came unassembled but assembly was easy. The batteries and quick-charger both arrived separately., The serial number suggested it might be \"self propelled\" with Greenworks but it is not. Fortunately it is very light. (Honestly it should be self-propelled for the high price.), Purchased package with two  80V batteries for extended cut time, which were supposed to cut up to an acre each on one charge. Laughable performance! Each battery cut less than 1/6 of an acre. I have 1 acre yard. I had to charge the batteries 3 times each and it look over 8 hours rotating the batteries between rapid charges to finish. Thoroughly disappointed there., The bagger sucks. It is not a big enough itself or has a big enough port to allow thick grass to flow into the bag. I ended up with cuttings clogging the blades and stalling the engine spilling out all over the place.

I only use it a few days each month in a carpeted bedroom.  Otherwise its kept neatly folded in its bag. I recently inflated it and kept waking up about every 3 hours having to re-inflate it. I woke up with my back and neck hurting, and extremely sleep deprived. I tried for several days to keep it inflated and to find where the slow leak was coming from. Then I left town and contacted the seller. He replied that I should contact Intex because its still under warranty. I ended up speaking with a Rep who stated to file a claim I had to find the pinhole leak and cut out a 6x6 inch section of the airbed where it was leaking, then take a picture of the Intex logo on the bed. After taking this dangerous action of stabbing and cutting up the layered and reinforced airbed, she said take a picture of the cut out and upload it and the logo picture to the claim website. She said Intex will not honor their warranty if this isnt done. She also said if approved it would take months to receive the replacement.  I asked what am I supposed to sleep on after destroying the airbed and waiting for months. She couldnt care less. She also refused to transfer me to a supervisor. I searched again and discovered the leak was at the pump. I took a picture of the pump and of the now almost deflated Intex logo and uploaded it with a copy of my Amazon shipping receipt. They immediately denied my claim. I called and the Rep said I didnt send pictures of the cut up airbed.  I asked for a supervisor. She put me on hold a long time and when she came back she pretended that she couldnt hear me and hung up. Although she had initially asked for all of my info at the beginning of the call, including my phone number, she didnt call back. Amazon wont help because they state its a 3rd party vendor. I havent even  been able to reach a human Amazon Customer Service Rep. I filed a complaint with my State Attorney Generals office and the FTC due to shoddy defective material, lack of customer service and refusing to honor the warranty.\""

Fine-blade Royal Zoysia.), Verdict:  This is a miserable machine and performs terribly for a lawn mower. waste of money., The machine took almost two weeks to arrive. It came unassembled but assembly was easy. The batteries and quick-charger both arrived separately., The serial number suggested it might be \"self propelled\" with Greenworks but it is not. Fortunately it is very light. (Honestly it should be self-propelled for the high price.), Purchased package with two  80V batteries for extended cut time, which were supposed to cut up to an acre each on one charge. Laughable performance! Each battery cut less than 1/6 of an acre. I have 1 acre yard. I had to charge the batteries 3 times each and it look over 8 hours rotating the batteries between rapid charges to finish. Thoroughly disappointed there., The bagger sucks. It is not a big enough itself or has a big enough port to allow thick grass to flow into the bag. I ended up with cuttings clogging the blades and stalling the engine spilling out all over the place. So I tried to mulch? The  grass just caked onto the blades and the engine stalled repeatedly., I'm sure there are \"good\" electric mowers out there, this is not one of them.

It had low miles and drove great, but the interior was a bit depressing. The Xterra was meant to be temporary until I could find what I really wanted. I didnt mind driving it but I missed the nice, comfortable interior of my Sequoia. I wondered how differently I would feel about the Xterra if I could make it more enjoyable to be in. So I bought these seat covers and some other accessories.  The covers fit like they are custom-made for the seats and headrests. It took only a few minutes to put them on. I was worried that the covers would shift when I got in and out of the car and that I would be constantly readjusting them.  This is not the case.  I was also worried that the seats would feel hot but that isnt happening either.  They (along with the other items I have purchased) have completely transformed the look and feel of my Xterras interior and have made the car more pleasurable to drive. In fact, Im no longer looking for another vehicle.  I included several images. One includes a tiny plastic bag with metal hooks you will need to attach to elastic bands that are on each side of the seat covers. Youll add the hooks to the bands and attach the hooks to each other under the seat. Im mentioning this because the bag is so tiny, it could easily be overlooked.  I cant report on the durability of the seat covers as they have only been in use for a week. I will report back after a few months.  For the price, Ill be happy if I can get a year out of them. I would happily reorder and definitely recommend them.\""

                "content": "Instruction: Extract the experience-rich sentence based on given specification list:\nSpecifications list: ingredients of vitamins-b-complex-supplements\nReview text:   Updated as of 12/5/2020:, \"I have known that I have the MTHFR gene mutation for about 10 years now.  Even after diagnosis, I was using a few other B-complexes which I though were o.k. for my condition, but I did not realize that the B6 was not methylated.  Turns out B6 has to be in the form of Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate, NOT Pyroxidine, to be more bioavailable to those who have MTHFR and do not methylate properly.  I never knew that until about 3 years ago; the doctor I tested with didnt explain that part.\", After this discovery, I researched various B-complex formulas, and picked this one.  I also wanted a B-complex that had methylated folic acid and that did not have a super high dose of methylcobalamin (B12), since my blood was testing high for B12 already.  This formula fit the bill very well., A few other tips:, 1)  The amount of methylated folic acid per capsule here is low (400mcg).  If you only take one capsule per day, I would also recommend taking additional methyl-folate if you do not methylate.  However, please first discuss with your chosen physician, if possible., 2)  If you take B6 in its methylated form of Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (a.k.a. P5P), you also need to  take magnesium so that the P5P pathway will work properly.  .Without at least some magnesium to work with, you may end up feeling tired and with lower energy, which is probably not what you want., 3)  B6 - along with certain co-factors like magnesium, zinc, vitamin-C, and folate, is necessary for the production of certain neurotransmitters like GABA and norepinephrine, as well as for the conversion of tryptophan or 5-HTP into serotonin.  So you may want to consider taking some of these additional co-factors to enhance your results with this product (only folate is included in this product, you would have to buy the rest separately).  Also note: Tyrosine is also required for the synthesis of dopamine, but I have not tried taking that yet., \"I believe I have been low in neurotransmitter production, and my nervous system has been a mess, due to a 12-year highly stressful job and the resulting sky-high cortisol levels (Thankfully, I am no longer at the job!).  Its been getting better slowly now.....it takes time and its also helpful to decrease your sugar intake.\", 4)  B6 and zinc are both needed for the production of pancreatic enzymes and hydrochloric acid, so if you have low stomach acid / poor digestion, this may help.  (Zinc is not included in this formula but you may wish to add it if you are looking to help your production of digestive enzymes), \"In summary, this formula really helps with all the above, and it may help you too.  Douglas Labs also makes a similar formula although it has some variation in its mix.  Best wishes to you.\", \"Further update since 2017:  Back in 2017-2018, started taking the Thorne Basic B once a day plus an additional 50mg -100mg of P5P.  Sometimes I would miss a day of both, Im not perfect :).  Eventually I got more disciplined and was taking the Basic B twice a day.  I felt that was working better for me.  Overall I can say for sure that the combo has helped to calm down my nervous system.  I even went through some serious surgeries and medical procedures (extremely stressful) in 2017 and 2018, and in the past I would be a nervous wreck 24/7 and would not be able to calm down.  However, I no longer get that uncontrollable anxiety anymore, although there can be some days where I can still fall into a depressive state.  Magnesium powder or capsules have also helped keep me calmer (at bedtime), and I have taken some Skullcap, Ashwagandha, and/or Passionflower at times to further calm myself down as needed.\", Since 2018 I have also tried other methylated B-complex formulas like MethylPro, Douglas Labs, Pure Encapsulations, Nordic Naturals, and Metabolic Maintenance - just to experiment.  However I keep returning to this one because it seems to work the best for my physiology.  Together with the P5P, this has been like a lifeline for me."

Wanted to find a totally organic product. Fortunately this product does not contain magnesium stearate, stearic acid, citric acid (derived from GMO black mold) or soy. It does however use silica., The pills are large and somewhat hard. So I chew them, let that sit under my tongue for about a minute while it mixes with my saliva for better digestion and then wash it down with water.  A double benefit --- it works sublingually and is pre-digested with saliva for ease of use by the body. This, in my opinion is the most beneficial way to take them.  (Also the most nutritious and beneficial way to drink a smoothie.), \"Rated only 4 stars because havent taken them long enough yet to notice a full beneficial effect. The stars are for packaging, the non-GMO status, for not using the stearates (magnesium stearate, stearic acid, etc which are toxic and in so many other vitamin products today) and MegaFoods effort to create a whole food product.\", \"A suggestion to MegaFood.

Here are my thoughts after 2 days of testing and running through my day to day gaming and work routines., \"The keyboard is very quiet and sits low to the desk. This actually makes it for a present typing experience for both my work and gaming sessions without the need of a wrist rest. My mouse mat provides adequate cushion so that my hands to feel too tired out so your mileage my vary based on your current setup. Keys are evenly spaces out are both typing and gaming produce no typos nor missed keys due to layout. Theyre also quiet enough that my mic does not pick up the typing during my zoom meetingsOne issue I have with many of these macro keyboards is there need to always place keys on the left side of the esc/tab/caps lock/ etc keys. This , for me, causes me to not adapt to my muscle memory typing and love that these keys are placed alongside the top of the keyboard.\", The macro/G/and media keys feel \"mushy\" to the touch. I think they could of gone with a better key like ones that mirror the keyboard. The dedicated media keys lack a mute key which is something I miss coming from the Roccat keyboard it's replacing but not a deal breaker. The scrolling wheel requires one to make a slow continuous roll of the key in order to register the volume up/down by windows. Scrolling too fast results in a step down by one point in volume., \"Connectivity is great. You get various options from wireless bluetooth, 2.4ghz,  and USB. Theres a switch located on the left hand side to tell the keyboard youre either going wired (off position) or connecting wirelessly (BT/2.4 ghz) As I use this for both my personal and work keyboard, I hooked up the dongle to a hub and registered both devices to communicate with the dongle and see no issues with the keyboard working. Setup took abou 3 seconds with no additional software needed. You may also opt to hook it up via cable provided (USB C) and have it hardwired if thats something you prefer. In my testing, I didnt notice any significant difference in typing or gaming (via dongle).\", Battery has been stellar. I typed and gamed for a few hours and the keyboard did not register the need to recharge. One item I wish was added was the ability to see how much battery is left via the LED indicator provided. Oddly enough, when the keyboard is operating via 2.4, the charging indicator glows red to indicate it's charging but is white when the keyboard is connected via PC in wired mode (maybe to indicate it's on wired mode and charging?). The keyboard does turn of LEDs about 1 min after typing but does remain \"on\" so you don't need to wake it via a keystroke to resume function. This can be a good or bad thing as you don't really know when the keyboard is actually off and the manual does not reference this., \"To me, this is a perfectly acceptable equivalent to the Logi G815 its trying to imitate. It does a good job of giving me the same look and feel as the keyboard with the premium it warrants. Sure you dont get per key lightning, better software, or premium material..but its a keyboard and it does a great job of doing enough for me to warrant a recommendation\""

The only difference is new key switches and the lack of Numpad for portability., \"The build quality is still amazing, just like their previous gaming keyboards. They use a solid metal plate at the bottom to keep the keyboard from twisting or bending while playing. Also, it makes is somewhat heavy, but thats a good thing, it keeps the keyboard from moving while gaming.\", \"The detachable cable is pretty neat, it is very sturdy, and it wont break easily.\", \"The software, at the beginning G-HUB, was very minimal, it was missing a lot of features from the old software, and I can understand why some people have issues with it. Still, it was only until recently that they made a lot of progress with their software and both my spouse and I are pretty happy with the software, mind you, we dont use macros, we like to change the lighting and the sensitivity settings, but overall it works just fine.\", \"The Blue-clicky keys, in my honest opinion, I dont feel that much of a difference while gaming compared to my old G810. The only difference is the clicky sound, which we own open-back headphones and the noise can get a little distracting sometimes so it wouldnt recommend getting the blue clicky if you enjoy your quietness.\", Now onto some of the issues that I have with this keyboard., SECONDARY KEYS DO NOT LIGHT  UP. Why is this even an issue?, \"There are other keyboards out there that light up both the primary and secondary functions keys. For a keyboard that is called PRO, this is a slap in the face, and on top of that they are not in the centre, all keycaps only light on the top row making it look weird, my G810 keys are all centred and they light both primary and secondary functions.\", \"They did not even bother to light up the functions that control the volume, good luck playing in the dark since the volume key doesnt light up you have to struggle in the dark trying to find the key.\", \"NO VOLUME CONTROL WHEEL, for a PRO keyboard youd think they would include one, even a small one, nope nothing all you get is a secondary function that acts as volume control, but sadly that does not light up in the dark so what is the point.\", And lastly, MICRO USB IN LATE 2019, yep when most devices are moving to type-c Logitech is still putting micro USB on all of their devices. I appreciate the detachable cable it makes it great when you need to store it away from travelling, but type-c is the standard for 2019, and I hope to see Logitech transition soon., Overall I give it a 5 star because of the build quality. It is very sturdy, and it feels great to use it. It is small perfect for small desk with not a lot of room and on top it all it is from Logitech, they have an excellent customer service staff, and they take care of their costumers."
