                "reviewText": "I ordered this toilet spray in the \u201cVanilla\u201d scent and the combination of vanilla oil, lemon oil, and lavender oil smells like a generic artificial tropical scent that is commonly used in public bathrooms. Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with.

The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "\"Weve used several other products such as this that only require one or two sprays per use.  Those bottles worked well when used in the horizontal position, or facing slightly downward.  The Natural Spray Before You Go bottle does not work well in the horizontal position.  You need to shake it before use.  These two things alone make this product less desirable for me.  The idea behind these products is that they leave a film of oil on the top of the water, which keeps the odors from coming up from the bowl....but this one is more of a fragrant spray, and doesnt seem to work in that manner....its more like it covers up the other scent with its citrus fresh lemon scent.  Because of the shaking, 3-5 sprays, poor bottle spraying performance, and the fact that this is less effective for what you want it to do...Im only giving it three stars.\"",

This Poo-Better Spray costs $1.85 per ounce., Poo-Better Spray is made of all natural essential oils, which is great, but the bottle comes with a warning to avoid excessive heat, fire sparks, open flame, direct sunshine rays and high temperatures. I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with.

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.  Quite frankly sometimes when you got to go, you got to go so using this takes some valuable seconds to do that.  Such situations can be the times when odor control is most needed.  For other more regular times, the process for using this toilet spray is fine.  Its also possible that visitors wont take the time to read the instructions on how to use this.

And no, Im not spraying it directly on my crotch, I know thats not how it works. And no, Im not spraying it while sitting on the toilet. I give two sprays into the bowl before even taking off my pants. Maybe its like how people with peanut allergies can have a reaction just from being close to peanuts. Anyway, gotta dilute it with some other oil.\"",

This Poo-Better Spray costs $1.85 per ounce., Poo-Better Spray is made of all natural essential oils, which is great, but the bottle comes with a warning to avoid excessive heat, fire sparks, open flame, direct sunshine rays and high temperatures. I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with. I have been keeping it strictly in the bathroom and away from our dogs completely.",

You get 2 in the box so it will last a while if your not too spray happy. 3-4 sprays is plenty of not you will choke on the flower scent. Good product but I may try a different smell next to round.",

I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with. I have been keeping it strictly in the bathroom and away from our dogs completely.",

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.  Quite frankly sometimes when you got to go, you got to go so using this takes some valuable seconds to do that.  Such situations can be the times when odor control is most needed.  For other more regular times, the process for using this toilet spray is fine.  Its also possible that visitors wont take the time to read the instructions on how to use this.

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

The idea behind these products is that they leave a film of oil on the top of the water, which keeps the odors from coming up from the bowl....but this one is more of a fragrant spray, and doesnt seem to work in that manner....its more like it covers up the other scent with its citrus fresh lemon scent.

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with.

The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

This Poo-Better Spray costs $1.85 per ounce., Poo-Better Spray is made of all natural essential oils, which is great, but the bottle comes with a warning to avoid excessive heat, fire sparks, open flame, direct sunshine rays and high temperatures. I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon.

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.  Quite frankly sometimes when you got to go, you got to go so using this takes some valuable seconds to do that.  Such situations can be the times when odor control is most needed.  For other more regular times, the process for using this toilet spray is fine.  Its also possible that visitors wont take the time to read the instructions on how to use this.

A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with.

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.

Watch the video and be prepared to get something that doesn\u2019t actually spray. Like the sprayer really sucks. It just sorta trickles out, gets on your hand when you\u2019re trying to spray it. Shaking it up doesn\u2019t do a thing to help. Pretty annoying actually \u2014 the more that I use it the more I\u2019m annoyed by it., I\u2019ll probably just spend a little more money next time and get something good., Scent is ok on the green one, very minty smell. I assume that it does its job when it comes to odor elimination, or at least I hope., UPDATE:, Somehow it\u2019s worse now. Barely sprays and leaks on your hand when spraying it. DO NOT BUY! Don\u2019t be like me and go for the cheapest thing to save a few bucks, it\u2019s not worth it. Each time I use it I become more annoyed with this. Spend a little extra on something else. This ones not worth your money. I\u2019m not angry I\u2019m just disappointed.",

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

But I decided to try this brand to see if the savings were too good to pass up., First things first, shipping was fine, no leakage. However once I started using the product as directed the fragrance does leak from the sprayer when being used or when you shake it as directed. If you choose not to shake, you don\u2019t have any leaks. However the fragrance is finished to the point where the product isn\u2019t effective.

However, the only problem is when I spray it in the toilet I find that a mist rises up and gets onto the toilet seat. So after you spray you have to wipe the seat or else the seat is damp with the product. Wish that the product wouldnt mist like it does, but otherwise it is good and I like it because it does the job it is intended to do.\"",

The idea behind these products is that they leave a film of oil on the top of the water, which keeps the odors from coming up from the bowl....but this one is more of a fragrant spray, and doesnt seem to work in that manner....its more like it covers up the other scent with its citrus fresh lemon scent.  Because of the shaking, 3-5 sprays, poor bottle spraying performance, and the fact that this is less effective for what you want it to do...Im only giving it three stars.\"",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this toilet spray in the \u201cVanilla\u201d scent and the combination of vanilla oil, lemon oil, and lavender oil smells like a generic artificial tropical scent that is commonly used in public bathrooms. Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

I give two sprays into the bowl before even taking off my pants. Maybe its like how people with peanut allergies can have a reaction just from being close to peanuts.

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.  Quite frankly sometimes when you got to go, you got to go so using this takes some valuable seconds to do that.  Such situations can be the times when odor control is most needed.  For other more regular times, the process for using this toilet spray is fine.  Its also possible that visitors wont take the time to read the instructions on how to use this.

The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

Since this is spritzed into the toilet bowl, the smell wafts up nicely as I sit there.  The downside of using this spray is it has to be squirted into the toilet bowl for 3 to 5 sprays plus shaken before that.  Quite frankly sometimes when you got to go, you got to go so using this takes some valuable seconds to do that.  Such situations can be the times when odor control is most needed.  For other more regular times, the process for using this toilet spray is fine.  Its also possible that visitors wont take the time to read the instructions on how to use this.

I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with. I have been keeping it strictly in the bathroom and away from our dogs completely.",

Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way.

This is most likely due to the oils and water separating between visits., Overall the spray fragrance is pleasant but doesn\u2019t do as good of a job as some other more expensive competitors., I won\u2019t be re-ordering from this brand unless something dramatically changes.

This Poo-Better Spray costs $1.85 per ounce., Poo-Better Spray is made of all natural essential oils, which is great, but the bottle comes with a warning to avoid excessive heat, fire sparks, open flame, direct sunshine rays and high temperatures. I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with. I have been keeping it strictly in the bathroom and away from our dogs completely.",

The idea behind these products is that they leave a film of oil on the top of the water, which keeps the odors from coming up from the bowl....but this one is more of a fragrant spray, and doesnt seem to work in that manner....its more like it covers up the other scent with its citrus fresh lemon scent.  Because of the shaking, 3-5 sprays, poor bottle spraying performance, and the fact that this is less effective for what you want it to do...Im only giving it three stars.\"",

Kind of fake smelling with just a hint of janitorial cleaner mixed in. It\u2019s not bad, just not exactly what I was expecting for something labeled as vanilla. The bottles are a decent size, but the sprayers are kind of finicky. This spray also has a tendency to billow in the air, up onto the toilet seat and onto the backside of whoever is on the toilet seat. Leaving an oily residue behind. Not really a fan of that, as I have very sensitive skin and a sensitive vaginal pH. So I resorted to spraying this spray in the toilet right after a BM. It actually works great that way. It stops the smells immediately and leaves behind a very pleasant scent in my bathroom.",

This Poo-Better Spray costs $1.85 per ounce., Poo-Better Spray is made of all natural essential oils, which is great, but the bottle comes with a warning to avoid excessive heat, fire sparks, open flame, direct sunshine rays and high temperatures. I have no idea why this warning is printed on the bottle and what will happen if expose to direct sunshine rays occurs, but this makes me a little nervous. We have a window in our bathroom., This spray does work. It does smell nice and the oils seem harmless enough - lemon, vanilla and lavender. It smells like lemon. A lot of lemon., The bottle does leak if you tip it up in the smallest amount. I often use our bathroom sprays to eliminate kitchen odors, but this spray I have been more cautious with. I have been keeping it strictly in the bathroom and away from our dogs completely.",

Watch the video and be prepared to get something that doesn\u2019t actually spray. Like the sprayer really sucks. It just sorta trickles out, gets on your hand when you\u2019re trying to spray it. Shaking it up doesn\u2019t do a thing to help. Pretty annoying actually \u2014 the more that I use it the more I\u2019m annoyed by it., I\u2019ll probably just spend a little more money next time and get something good., Scent is ok on the green one, very minty smell. I assume that it does its job when it comes to odor elimination, or at least I hope., UPDATE:, Somehow it\u2019s worse now. Barely sprays and leaks on your hand when spraying it. DO NOT BUY! Don\u2019t be like me and go for the cheapest thing to save a few bucks, it\u2019s not worth it. Each time I use it I become more annoyed with this. Spend a little extra on something else. This ones not worth your money. I\u2019m not angry I\u2019m just disappointed.",
