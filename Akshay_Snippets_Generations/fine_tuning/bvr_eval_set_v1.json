I like this mix of vitamin B because it covers all your \"B\" bases.  While I have tested low in 3 vitamins, it\\s possible to still be deficient and not pick up on it.  Taking this supplement seems to give me more energy so I may be undiagnosed in other vitamin deficiencies that testing is not detecting.  For your reference, I\\m adding this information., \"B vitamins are a group of eight essential nutrients that play roles in many organs and bodily systems. Although they can work together in the body, they also carry out their unique functions.  I was low in some B vitamins and I was taking many products.  Its nice to have it all in one bottle.\", There are eight types of B vitamin, each with their function:, thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin (vitamin B-2), niacin (vitamin B-3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5), vitamin B-6, biotin (vitamin B-7), folate (vitamin B-9), vitamin B-12, Together, they are called the vitamin B complex., If you having a lot of medical issues, take a look at what can happen if you are low in Vitamin B:, Thiamin (vitamin B-1), The heart, liver, kidney, and brain all contain high amounts of thiamin. The body needs thiamin for:, breaking down sugar (carbohydrate) molecules from food, creating certain neurotransmitters (brain chemicals), producing fatty acids, synthesizing certain hormones, Symptoms of thiamin deficiency, A person with a thiamin deficiency may experience:, weight loss, little or no appetite, memory problems or confusion, heart problems, tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, loss of muscle mass, poor reflexes, Riboflavin (vitamin B-2), Riboflavin is essential for:, energy production, helping the body break down fats, drugs, and steroid hormones, converting tryptophan into niacin (vitamin B-3), converting vitamin B-6 into a coenzyme that the body needs, A person who is deficient in riboflavin may experience:, skin disorders, sores at the corners of the mouth, swelling of the mouth and throat, swollen, cracked lips, hair loss, red, itchy eyes, Niacin B-3, The body converts niacin into a coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a necessary part of more than 400 different enzyme reactions in the body, the highest of all vitamin-derived coenzymes. These enzymes help with:, changing the energy in carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into a form the body can use, \"metabolic processes in the bodys cells\", communication among cells, expression of DNA in cells, Symptoms of niacin deficiency, Getting too little niacin can cause a niacin deficiency. Severe niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, which may cause:, brown discoloration on skin exposed to sunlight, patches of skin with a rough appearance, a bright red tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation, headache, fatigue, depression, Pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5), Pantothenic acid is necessary for the body to create new coenzymes, proteins, and fats., Red blood cells carry pantothenic acid throughout the body so it can use the nutrient in a variety of processes for energy and metabolism., Symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency, Pantothenic acid deficiency is rare in the U.S. because it is plentiful in many foods. However, it may affect people with severe malnutrition. In such cases, they are usually deficient in other nutrients as well., Symptoms of deficiency include:, numbness and burning of the hands and feet, headache, irritability, restlessness and poor sleep, a lack of appetite, People with a specific gene mutation called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration 2 mutations are at a high risk of deficiency, Vitamin B-6, Vitamin B-6, or pyridoxine, plays a role in more than 100 enzyme reactions. The body needs vitamin B-6 for:, amino acid metabolism, breaking down carbohydrates and fats, brain development, immune function, Symptoms of vitamin B-6 deficiency, Many deficiencies in vitamin B-6 are linked to low levels of vitamin B-12, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements., Vitamin B-6 deficiency may cause:, anemia, scaling on the lips, cracks at corners of the mouth, swollen tongue, weakened immune system, confusion, depression, Biotin (vitamin B-7), Manufacturers often add biotin to hair, skin, and nail supplements. However, the NIH state that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude whether taking extra biotin helps with hair, skin, or nails., Some people believe that biotin may help with psoriasis., The human body needs biotin for:, breaking down fats, carbohydrates, and protein, communication among cells in the body, regulation of DNA, Symptoms of biotin deficiency, Signs of a biotin deficiency include:, thinning of the hair, a scaly rash around eyes, nose, and mouth, brittle nails, depression, fatigue, Folate (vitamin B-9), The natural form of vitamin B-9 is called folate. Folic acid, which is present in fortified foods and some supplements, is a synthetic form of the vitamin., Because most people cannot take in enough leafy green vegetables for the levels needed in pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that all women of reproductive age who wish to conceive take 400 mcg of folic acid each day, alongside eating a varied diet that contains folate., When a woman has high enough levels of folate both before and during pregnancy, the fetus has a lower risk of certain birth defects affecting the brain and spinal cord., Folate is also essential for:, DNA replication, metabolism of vitamins, metabolism of amino acids, proper cell division, Symptoms of folate deficiency, The addition of folic acid to grain products has made folate deficiency uncommon. However, the possible symptoms of a folate deficiency may include:, weakness, headache, heart palpitations, irritability, sores on the tongue or in the mouth, skin, hair, or nail changes, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin B-12 contains the mineral cobalt and is sometimes called a \"cobalamin.\" The body uses vitamin B-12 for:, creating new red blood cells, DNA synthesis, brain and neurological function, fat and protein metabolism, Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency, Vitamin B-12 deficiency usually causes a condition called megaloblastic anemia. Symptoms of a vitamin B-12 deficiency can include:, fatigue, weight loss, constipation, loss of appetite, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, memory problems, depression, However, some evidence suggests that a full B-complex vitamin supplement may be a better choice, even if a person has just one deficiency., The researchers state that most people have deficiencies and would benefit from a high-dose B-complex supplement."

First of all, its fully automatic cleaning system significantly reduces the burden of owners, not only eliminating the tediousness of frequent scooping, but also creating a unanimous resonance among users of \"no need to scoop poop every day anymore\"., The design of this litter box takes into account the comfort of cats by matching the appropriate height and step design, making it easier for cats to adapt. For cats who enjoy the drama of a TV show during the cleaning process, the low-noise design of the automatic cleanup allows them to finish their \"show\" without being disturbed., Overall, the CATLINK Scooper Luxury Pro-X automatic cat litter box is not only an efficient and convenient cleaning tool, but also a product that combines intelligent technology with humanized design. It changes the experience of using a traditional litter box and provides cat owners with a more relaxing and cleaner cat living environment. As a pet blogger, I have no hesitation in recommending this excellent automatic cat litter box to readers who are concerned about the quality of life of their pets, and I believe that it will bring a new and comfortable experience for you and your cats."

Then one started making a loud grinding noise, and soon a \"no drum found\" error popped up and it stopped working completely. We followed the instructions to address the issue, nothing worked. Then I spent two months seeking customer support from the seller, with zero responses (I used the support info in their manual). Our litter boxes are still under warranty, and I then reached out to see if Amazon could help. Amazon sent me to the third party reseller message board, where I got a prompt response from Comfipaws that they will replace the item., The other litter box is hanging in there, but we have to manually reset it every single time a cat uses it. So now, we leave it off, and then just turn it on once a day to clean it, in the hopes that it will last., I do appreciate the replacement. We will work with these for as long as they will last bc they were expensive, but not nearly as expensive as litter robot."

B-12 deficiency is common from longterm use). I started taking just the nature b-12 supplements and immediately noticed my energy levels were better, I was less nauseous, just overall felt really good. I saw the b complex plus c at the store and decided to give it a try. Overall, the taste is pretty gross but that\u2019s fine. I love the extra b vitamins, they help with my nausea as well. The only issue is the vitamin C. Triggers my acid reflux. It upsets my stomach a little while after taking it and gives me heart burn occasionally :/. I always take it after filling my tummy so it\u2019s a shame that doesn\u2019t help. Googling it, apparently it\u2019s common. There is non-acidic c tablets made out of Sodium Ascorbate on Amazon so maybe think about releasing one that\u2019s non-acidic?

The lawnmower didn\u2019t come with a charger or a rechargeable battery. But the unit sale price was a good deal. So by time I added a 6 Ahr rechargeable battery and the Greenworks Quick charging unit, the total price for all items was still a good deal., Buying this way(separately the charger, battery, lawnmower), allowed me to get the best performing system. The quick charging Charger, gave the battery a much faster charging up of the high power battery I purchased. The 40 V 6 Ahrs rechargeable battery lasted much longer than the standard 2 Ahrs battery that normally sell as a complete setup at some places., The lawnmower worked fine. There wasn\u2019t much to assemble here. The only negatives I have is the lawn bag is small and due to it mesh material, a lot of dusts and pollens will shoot out from bag; my lawn has a lot of dried dead spots.  So I had to wear a mask to mow the lawn. Other than that it cut and maneuver great. It isn\u2019t as noisy as my gas mower and no pollution., A follow up of mower and it accessories:, It is now around 6 moths and I have mowed by lawn 3 times and still on original charge. If you wait until your lawn is very tall, then the mower does have to struggle a bit to cut the grass. But still did a good job of cutting it; you just do a second pass, over area that didn\u2019t cut completely."

Im wheeling the pump vac all around furniture, so it needs to be flexible, and the pump vac will build up pressure and start to spit if it doenst have clear drainage, so kink resistance is key. Id previously used a heavy duty hose that was kink-resistant, but that was also heavy, stiff, and difficult to coil, so it would just end up slung into a big pile on the boiler room floor, where it would get dirty and gross when it flooded.\", \"This one is both kink resistant--when its bent and I tug on it from across the room, it doesnt collapse into a kink--and flexible enough to coil back up easily when the job is done. It makes good connections and its heavy enough to stay put but not too heavy to manage. Im happy.\""

I must say, this electric dethatcher has exceeded my expectations. I have purchased other brands in the past and have been left with disappointment. This dethatcher has made my lawn transformation an an absolute breeze., \"First and foremost, the 15 Amp motor is powerful enough to handle even the toughest thatch and debris, leaving my lawn looking beautifully groomed and ready for new grass seed. The 16-inch width of the dethatcher provides excellent coverage, allowing me to complete the task in less time compared to other models Ive used in the past.\", One of the standout features of this dethatcher is its user-friendly design. The adjustable depth settings make it incredibly versatile, catering to various types of lawns and which allowed me to customize the dethatching depth to meet my specific needs for debris removal. The ergonomic handle is comfortable to grip, and the machine is lightweight, making it easy to maneuver around my yard without feeling fatigued., \"I also appreciate the durable construction of the Rock&Rocker dethatcher. It feels robust and built to last, ensuring that Ill be able to enjoy its benefits for years to come. Additionally, the maintenance requirements are minimal, saving me valuable time and effort.\", \"What sets the Rock&Rocker 16-Inch 15 Amp Electric Dethatcher apart is its efficient performance. It effectively removes thatch and debris, promoting better nutrient absorption, water penetration, and overall lawn health. Ive used this at my parents house also with their Bermuda lawn and have noticed a significant improvement in the thickness and lushness of their lawn since I used this dethatcher. (With the proper care and water after of course.)\", Overall, I highly recommend the Rock&Rocker 16-Inch 15 Amp Electric Dethatcher to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient lawn maintenance tool. Its powerful motor, adjustable settings, user-friendly design, and excellent performance make it a fantastic investment for achieving a healthy and beautiful lawn."

Major adjustments require removing the wheel to adjust to the lower tiers of height. Superb little mower for the price I have just scalped my yard with it to slightly under 1/2in by removing the roller entirely and will maintain it at .6-.75in for the rest of the season. Amazing workout as well., Photos first is at 1in or so before mid season scalp and the others are during scalping at ~.5in., Again remove the hubcap and the clip that holds the wheel on and slide the wheel off and loosen and remove the nut on the axel and lower the position. Repeat on both sides., A good video tutorial is available if you search \u201cReel Mower Major Height Adjustment\u201d it\u2019s only a few minutes long., Edit: after making all the adjustments and trying on one section that I leveled recently the height of cut is sub 1/2in it is something closer to 1/3in I\u2019ll use calipers and a better reference later for now I used some paper I had nearby and it worked out to .335in which is nice because I can easily scalp at that .35-.4in and maintain between .5-.75in and not have to worry about the brown showing on my Bermuda grass.

My two smaller cats love it but my big fluffy boy will only use it from time to time, he is not a huge fan. It works amazing for managing the typical odors issue, better than anything Ive tried so far. The tracking sensors are also great for keeping an eye on a key health indicator for kitties, overall it is a dream for cat parents.\", \"That being said, I just dont know that I feel  it has a balanced value ratio.

There have already been some issues that have to do some litter shopping to find one that works best. The litter pan has dislodged a couple times, not sure why. But the less conventional litters they say will work, I found do not really.

Although Ive only been using it for a few weeks, Im genuinely surprised by how much I prefer it over the older-style black hose.\", One notable improvement is the design of the ribs, which run lengthwise instead of circular wrapping. I believe this change enhances its strength and durability. Additionally, with its generous 100 ft length, my previous black hose would seemingly take forever to empty once I turned off the spigot. In contrast, this hose seems to empty a lot quicker, which is a time-saver., Furthermore, the inclusion of the nozzle, holder, and washers with this unit is a definite plus. Overall, I consider this product a winner in my book."

I am so in love with nugget ice that while expensive it has been worth it to me.  My opal is down again and I\u2019m furious. Enter this little gem! I am pleasantly surprised how well this machine performs! It is so easy to use, just plug it in, fill it with water and push a button, within 5 minutes you will have ice. Within 10 minutes you will have ice in your cup! And the cleaning process is a dream!! I run a cleaning cycle on the machine first. Then, it is light enough to carry it to the sink. The drain plug is on the bottom so I just situate it on the counter hanging over the sink just enough that it drains right in. I do a quick rinse with a little soap and water to make sure the reservoir is sanitized. Done! A few downsides compared to the opal\u2026no water tank so you have to manually fill the water reservoir fairly often (at least once a day), I was able to schedule the on/off operation via an app (this is nice to have it turn on at 5am so that I have ice for my workouts at 6), the ice container is larger so it holds more and doesn\u2019t get jammed up stopping the ice making. All in all I am super pleased with this machine. Great value!"

I have other Greenworks products that worked well. Put it to the test with new manicured Zoysia sod lawn.  (Not a Hayfield or farm with tough grass. Fine-blade Royal Zoysia.), Verdict:  This is a miserable machine and performs terribly for a lawn mower. waste of money., The machine took almost two weeks to arrive. It came unassembled but assembly was easy. The batteries and quick-charger both arrived separately., The serial number suggested it might be \"self propelled\" with Greenworks but it is not. Fortunately it is very light. (Honestly it should be self-propelled for the high price.), Purchased package with two  80V batteries for extended cut time, which were supposed to cut up to an acre each on one charge. Laughable performance! Each battery cut less than 1/6 of an acre. I have 1 acre yard. I had to charge the batteries 3 times each and it look over 8 hours rotating the batteries between rapid charges to finish. Thoroughly disappointed there., The bagger sucks. It is not a big enough itself or has a big enough port to allow thick grass to flow into the bag. I ended up with cuttings clogging the blades and stalling the engine spilling out all over the place. So I tried to mulch? The  grass just caked onto the blades and the engine stalled repeatedly., I'm sure there are \"good\" electric mowers out there, this is not one of them. Sorry, Greenworks but this one is a fail! I will be returning."

Easy to maneuver, the blades dont spin when you back up making it very easy to pull back and relatively light.\", \"4. No gas, oil or batteries that need charging and dont last.\", 5. Reel blades cut a healthier grass., \"6. Easy storage, doesnt take up much space or omit gas fumes.\", Bad, 1. Cuts narrow rows, would not be practical on a big yard., 2. Finicky about debris and uneven terrain., \"3. Doesnt cut all weeds and supposedly doesnt work well in all types of grass.\", 4. Can leave uneven patches that need multiple passes if grass is longer and laying flat., Basically this mower is great if you have a relatively small yard with a smooth established lawn., This specific push mower is good because it has five 16\" blades and a sturdy handle, (I didn't want a \"T\" handle as they seem flimsy). 16\" is fine for my yard and I figured it would take up less space and be slightly more maneuverable than the 18\". This model has a clear blade cover which I also like., Basically at least four brands including Scott are made by the same company.

Seat protectors are impoetant, but we also love the seat warmers and did not want something that that would interfere with that., Of course, we have a heavier cover for the backseat that is waterproof but we also toss tools and buckets in without really being prepared.  The front seat bottoms are well protected and the back seat is too, but the front edge could be a bit longer.  Installing the back seat was easy, since the seat flips up.

I had to deflate my mattress unfold it inside my tent, un-stake my tent and then drag my tent to my truck where I was able to then inflate my mattress. This was extremely inconvenient. Now that I have this twin size mattress I have the ability to fill my mattress and fit it in the door of my tent. My spouse and I decided it was best to have two separate twin mattresses over a larger mattress because of the better fit and the fact that we wont disturb the other throughout the night. The I-beam structure makes this air mattress very comfortable and it provides plenty of support. I appreciate the fact that this mattress can support 300lbs as I dont feel that it will pop for any reason. It is very durable and holds air perfectly through the night and is very easy to inflate. I like the square valve as well as its easier to open and close. The added carry bag is perfect the perfect size for the mattress its easy to fold and place it inside. I also like having this mattress not just for camping but its easy to store and home and pull out for a guest and it does not require much space, perfect for a sleepover.\""

I DO pick up large sticks prior to mowing, but it easily rides over small ones., The mower does occasionally  get hung up on a mid-size stick, but a half a roll backwards and it\u2019s  dislodged - no big deal! It does a marvelous job, takes up only a small amount of garage space and is easy to maintain! I run a blade sharpener over the blades once a month since my lawn is large and give it a shot of WD40 and it\u2019s all good! I am a fit middle age lady and had no trouble assembling or using this mower myself. The only thing that has slowed my mowing down, are random folks stopping me to ask about my old-timey mower! I encourage them all to  give one a try! Definitely recommend the 20 inch if your lawn is large. I have owned this mower for 6 months, and besides some minor fraying of the foam handle grip, have not had any issues or required any repairs. LOVE it!"

Im a pocket sized adult unfortunately that seemed to stop growing at 12, 112pds and 5ft. I was able to lift and carry the box in myself and after opening the box was able to lift the mower out with one hand (thankful for the handy little handle on the main portion of the mower.) I was a little disappointed to see this mower was mostly plastic bits. Once assembled (again, almost obscenely simple process) I used the convenient handle to lift and carry it back outside. After charging the battery and cranking this baby up, I was officially in love. I have bought several mowers, and every one of them were irritating to either carry, assemble or use. She may be small but she is mighty! I previously thought it was a brilliant idea to avoid irritating my neighbors with the noise and stupidly have been using a manual push mower, so my review may be colored by the difficulty of pushing through dense annoyingly healthy grass and weeds, but this mower is so quiet, I could hear my music on my headphones that I left around my neck. Even my husband on the video game inside didnt hear it. And the glory of gripping on to a mower that practically pushed itself was like an ice cold water being handed to you in a mosh pit as far from consessions as you can get. The height adjustment is great also. My 63 husband can push it as easily as I can, and so can my 10 year old (she is not happy about an added chore from time to time and that brings its own joy) Operation is dummy proof and it cuts through the heartiest of weeds like butter. The only downside is the grass catcher. I did need to empty it many times, but that was more due to my procrastination due to having unfortunate mowers until today. Now Im almost excited to see the grass grow annoyingly fast in monsoon season.\", All in all, this is an amazing mower for the price. It may not cut a wide path but that in itself is convenient for getting into the smaller spaces that seem unreasonably designed for a grassy swath of lawn. There is also a mulch plug which I also found convenient for my flower bed projects., \"I have a decent sized corner lot, and even with some heavy overgrowth in the back yard the battery lasted through 80% of my lot and recharged faster than my overused tablet charges. And my reservations on the plastic construction of it were unfounded. The materials are durable, even with my inherently clumsy nature, and the safety features are a big relief for that also. There is a safety key I can remove when I need to step away with my kids in the yard with me and start up is gentle so it doesnt scare the little humans so irritatingly playing in the middle of my planned route. So I have to give this a rare 5 star rating for being so perfectly made for small humans as well as large hulking beasts of a husband. And again, I must point out how quiet it is. Not a single eye roll from the neighbors with a new baby at 8 am!!! I did not have high hopes while assembling so I did not take any photos unfortunately. But if I can talk myself into avoiding mowing long enough to let the weeds have their 5 minutes of fame I will revise with some visuals. Highly recommended. (Though my daughter now disagrees)\""

There was some pinching from material behind the knee (where I tend to get some swelling with my injury) but the material was pliant enough that working it around a bit made it go away entirely., \"WORD OF WARNING.. on the sizing, though. If the size chart makes them look small, its because they are that small. The sizing chart is RIGHT ON THE MONEY. If you suspect you might need the Extra Large over the Large, get the Extra Large. I thought it was going to be a bit too big for me but its TIGHT and fits well. If youre overweight to a significant degree like I used to be (350lbs to 240lbs as of the time of purchase), you likely wont get it up around the thighs.

Having said that, you can get a very low cut in the first setting IF your cutting area is flat. I use the second setting most often. It's quiet, seems to cut with ease, works better than the other non-powered mowers I've tried, and that provides me the choice of mowing very early or very late (and to hear myself think while doing it). \"Going green\" is an additional benefit but that's not the main reason I got it. I wanted something to just quietly mow without the hassle of charging, using a long electrical cord, or having to gas up. This fits the bill for my use.

It is the best value with the backlighting and rbg around the frame. Everything works as expected. The bottom has very grippy rubber tabs. Overall its a higher value board sold for much less of its value. Hopefully it holds up after long term use., \" The only flaw is the wrist rest. When placing the weight of your arm on end of the rest it will cause the keyboard to tilt upward. Ive fixed this with a thin gel pad under the wrist rest. The edge of the wrist rest is bevelled and resting your wrist at the edge for large hands turns the bevelled edge into a pivot point. Which is why the mini keyboard will flip upward or raise up. This area should be redesigned or a stick on rubber pad should be given to fix this issue!\", \"I use this as an extra keyboard on my desk for flight sims. Its nice to move all my extra plane controls onto a dedicated keyboard that takes up less space while my big board is moved aside. It is also much cheaper to buy this instead of dedicated flight gear offering many times less buttons for a much higher premium. For my end use this is a good value product. For a gamer wanting a mini board this will work fine. Ive had no ghosting or delayed response issues. Plus the board is brightly lit making it great for dark room settings.

This innovative litter box goes beyond the ordinary, offering not only automated self-cleaning but also advanced features like app control, odor control, and health monitoring.\", The standout feature of this litter box is its automatic self-cleaning mechanism. The convenience of not having to scoop waste daily is a game-changer. The box intelligently detects when your cat has used it and initiates a cleaning cycle, ensuring a fresh and hygienic environment for your furry friend. The waste is efficiently scooped into a separate compartment, preventing odor buildup and minimizing the need for constant attention., \"The integration of a dedicated app takes cat care to the next level. With the app, I can conveniently monitor my cats litter box activity remotely. This not only provides peace of mind but also serves as a helpful tool in tracking any potential changes in my cats health. The app sends notifications for cleaning cycles, waste level alerts, and even tracks your cats bathroom habits, allowing for quick detection of irregularities that may require attention.\", Odor control is a significant plus with the CATLINK litter box. The combination of the self-cleaning mechanism and the carbon-filtered waste compartment effectively traps and neutralizes odors, ensuring a fresh and odor-free environment for both the cat and its owner., Setting up and maintaining the litter box is surprisingly easy. The waste compartment is easily accessible and detachable, making cleaning a breeze. The thoughtful design also minimizes litter tracking outside the box, keeping the surrounding area clean., While the CATLINK Automatic Litter Box comes with a higher upfront cost, the long-term benefits in terms of time saved, reduced maintenance, and improved cat health monitoring make it a worthwhile investment for cat owners seeking a premium and hassle-free litter box solution., \"In conclusion, the CATLINK Automatic Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box is a game-changing addition to any cat owners home.

Not this exact model any longer, however my overall thoughts on the new one far surpass my thoughts on the one you are reading the review for. This is still a nice mower, but a single blade unit might be a better option., \"Ive had this lawn mower for about 2 years (purchased 6/21/21, review date 7/6/23).\", \"Its small, but fairly mighty. Until recently it has operated really well and I would have recommended it to anyone looking for a smaller, battery powered lawn mower.\", \"However, a few weeks ago I began noticing one of the blades would struggle to spin from time to time and grass would be left uncut. With the two blade system this has, it is very noticeable if a blade isnt doing its share of the work. My first thought was that perhaps I needed to sharpen the blades. So I took out my owner manual and took every step required to replace the blades with new sharp blades. After the new blades were installed and the entire under carriage of the mower was thoroughly cleaned of all debris, I began mowing again. Unfortunately the blade itself does not appear to be the issue.\", \"At this point I decided to contact Greenworks for warranty service. I spoke with a very pleasant individual who assured me all would be taken care of. We talked through some basic troubleshooting, and general questions including if I had tried replacing the blades. Since I had we went to the next step of checking if a repair center was close by to get it in. Unfortunately the closest one was over 60 miles away so they would not send me to that one. The representative asked if I could be placed on a brief hold while they checked with their supervisor for options. This is where things went sideways, when they really shouldnt have.\", The supervisor requested a picture of the underside of my mower. Fine, no problem, while on the call still I took a picture and emailed it over. A few more questions came up about my replacement of the blades and the process I used. I explained I used the exact steps outlined in the owners manual, which included using a piece of wood to stop the blade from spinning while using a wrench to loosen the nut from the bolt., \"The representative worked as an intermediary in my interaction with the supervisor, and instead of getting on a call with me to ask her questions had the rep relay their questions to me. It seemed odd that we were going down a path that felt like Greenworks was trying to find a way that this wouldnt be covered under warranty, despite the mower being in otherwise excellent condition with no wear and tear on it what-so-ever that could be attributed to the blade not spinning all the time like it should.\", Eventually, after the supervisor ran out of questions to ask, I was told that they think their \"system\" is not working correctly because they \"felt like\" a location for service should be closer to me than 60 miles. The solution I was offered is to wait a couple of days while they work on their system and try to find a repair shop nearby to offer me service. Which would be fine, but to get to this point I was on the phone a total of over an hour, and I was assured they would resolve my concerns on the call at the very start of the call., Ultimately I am left waiting for an answer about whether or not they have a service center near me. I suspect they do not, and their system also as of my call says they do not..., \"This experience and my entire feeling about Greenworks is feeling really sour at this point. Id like this to be fixed or replaced as the warranty says it will with this type of issue... making me wait and trying every possible thing to get out of covering it feels really bad.\""

Even after diagnosis, I was using a few other B-complexes which I though were o.k. for my condition, but I did not realize that the B6 was not methylated.  Turns out B6 has to be in the form of Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate, NOT Pyroxidine, to be more bioavailable to those who have MTHFR and do not methylate properly.  I never knew that until about 3 years ago; the doctor I tested with didnt explain that part.\", After this discovery, I researched various B-complex formulas, and picked this one.  I also wanted a B-complex that had methylated folic acid and that did not have a super high dose of methylcobalamin (B12), since my blood was testing high for B12 already.  This formula fit the bill very well., A few other tips:, 1)  The amount of methylated folic acid per capsule here is low (400mcg).  If you only take one capsule per day, I would also recommend taking additional methyl-folate if you do not methylate.  However, please first discuss with your chosen physician, if possible., 2)  If you take B6 in its methylated form of Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate (a.k.a. P5P), you also need to  take magnesium so that the P5P pathway will work properly.  .Without at least some magnesium to work with, you may end up feeling tired and with lower energy, which is probably not what you want., 3)  B6 - along with certain co-factors like magnesium, zinc, vitamin-C, and folate, is necessary for the production of certain neurotransmitters like GABA and norepinephrine, as well as for the conversion of tryptophan or 5-HTP into serotonin.  So you may want to consider taking some of these additional co-factors to enhance your results with this product (only folate is included in this product, you would have to buy the rest separately).  Also note: Tyrosine is also required for the synthesis of dopamine, but I have not tried taking that yet., \"I believe I have been low in neurotransmitter production, and my nervous system has been a mess, due to a 12-year highly stressful job and the resulting sky-high cortisol levels (Thankfully, I am no longer at the job!).  Its been getting better slowly now.....it takes time and its also helpful to decrease your sugar intake.\", 4)  B6 and zinc are both needed for the production of pancreatic enzymes and hydrochloric acid, so if you have low stomach acid / poor digestion, this may help.  (Zinc is not included in this formula but you may wish to add it if you are looking to help your production of digestive enzymes), \"In summary, this formula really helps with all the above, and it may help you too.  Douglas Labs also makes a similar formula although it has some variation in its mix.  Best wishes to you.\", \"Further update since 2017:  Back in 2017-2018, started taking the Thorne Basic B once a day plus an additional 50mg -100mg of P5P.  Sometimes I would miss a day of both, Im not perfect :).  Eventually I got more disciplined and was taking the Basic B twice a day.  I felt that was working better for me.  Overall I can say for sure that the combo has helped to calm down my nervous system.  I even went through some serious surgeries and medical procedures (extremely stressful) in 2017 and 2018, and in the past I would be a nervous wreck 24/7 and would not be able to calm down.  However, I no longer get that uncontrollable anxiety anymore, although there can be some days where I can still fall into a depressive state.  Magnesium powder or capsules have also helped keep me calmer (at bedtime), and I have taken some Skullcap, Ashwagandha, and/or Passionflower at times to further calm myself down as needed.\", Since 2018 I have also tried other methylated B-complex formulas like MethylPro, Douglas Labs, Pure Encapsulations, Nordic Naturals, and Metabolic Maintenance - just to experiment.  However I keep returning to this one because it seems to work the best for my physiology.  Together with the P5P, this has been like a lifeline for me."

CUts great - BUT.... The blade height goes to 7\" HOWEVER!!!!  Only the rear end goes up, the front does not - on what planet that makes sense I dont know but it doesnt make sense on Earth!  If the grass is 5-6\" tall and the front only goes to a max of 3\"  you are using up the battery life, and your strength to push it as you are literally forcing the grass to lye down - so you wind up mowing like you vacuum... you have to go over and over the same spot - you have to lift the front end or the grass will kill the battery and you have to wait and then re-start - I cant use the self-propelled cause it drains the battery super fast... I wish I had known - it really sucks to be blunt.  Also I was smart enough to buy 1 extra battery -I should have bought 3 extra batteries - cause what used to take 3.5 hrs with my good ole' gas powered mower now takes me 3 DAYS between waiting for the batteries to charge and having to \"vacuum\" most of the lawn.  ALSO - THEY NO LONGER HAVE THESE BATTERIES - AT ALL!  So - $500 for a mower and when the batteries die out - you have a $500 POS. I would not recommend - I am angry and disgusted and depressed cause I still have to use it to mow - I ordered a diff replacement battery but not sure if it will work or not.  REMEMBER this when you go for an electric car - I cant even imagine!!! I should have known better tho - I had a Greenworks electric trimmer - the battery died - there were NO replacements - had to buy a new one - that was bad at $80 - but this!!!!!  Grrr."

I quickly realized the compact storage option was not going to be quick and easy each time, but ok... a little extra nut loosening will be tolerable., The first time I used it I was actually impressed. Quiet, lightweight and excellent maneuverability. Easy to pick up and move to other areas or up steps., \"Second time I needed it... I learned that one of the batteries was bad. (just outside of the return period) I looked and looked for customer service numbers, emails, or a way to contact Worx. Finally I resorted to twitter. I got a response within a day..... Then reply about every 10 days. Its Been nearly 2 months with no progress, repeatedly needing to explain the problem and send pics of the batteries/serial numbers/ model number. Im so angry with this company, and the fact that I wasted my money. do yourself a favor and dont do the same. Look for another mower, from another manufacturer.\""

It has served as my main bed for months on end at times. When I\u2019ve had a normal bed, it does normal spare mattress things like coming out for house guests and living room movie nights., The inflating and deflating motor still works perfectly. It has given me no issues. This is the heart and soul of this excellent product., The heavy thick mattress itself has never needed maintenance or repairs. I have been careful about where I put it and have always rolled it up nice and tight for storage., This mattress has transcended its intended purpose of just being a giant inflatable bag to lay down on. It has become a permanent, essential resource for the home, in the same way that a homeowners toolkit, first aid, and emergency food storages are for certain homes., It is one of the most shrewd quality of life investments I have ever made. I bought it as a nomadic kid in my early 20s moving all over the country, and it has stayed with me as I\u2019ve settled down in the midwest as a homeowner, and it has always and continues to make my life easier., If you\u2019re shopping for an air mattress, this is THE air mattress. It\u2019s the only one."

After that it rotates back the other way and re-scatters the litter with a couple more rocking motions.  Takes about five minutes for the cleaning cycle, all told.

As I use a 4 port KVM switch that uses the Scroll Lock button to change computer ports.. it was affecting the operation of the backlight of the keyboard turning off, then when turning the keyboard backlight on again by pressing scroll Lock I would lose the ability to scroll in programs like Excel using the arrow keys., The situation could not be worked around., So after reading all the reviews of multiple RGB keyboards, I settled on this hyper x keyboard as it has a dedicated backlight button. And it works perfectly, leaving the scroll Lock free for port switching., As to the keyboard itself, build quality is great! Keys are softer and quieter than my previous keyboard. I was hoping for it to be almost silent but it still has a bit of clicking and clacking., The RGB lighting is a really nice touch, 2 levels of brightness and about 7 presets of lighting and 7 colors to choose from., \"This keyboard was great value for money and Im glad I pulled the trigger on this.

Compared to the Fiskar reel mowers though this does have a spinning blade that is exposed on the rear side so if a child were to try pushing this (the low horizontal bar is very intriguing for little ones to push), it could be catastrophic. I would absolutely not recommend this if you have little kids that might try to push this mower!, But, for those that do not have kids and are looking for a decent semi inexpensive reel mower with some width to it, this is a pretty good option. It\u2019s not made as heavy duty or engineered, quite as well as some of the more expensive real mowers but it does get the job done, but likely requires two passes., The downfall of the world is compared to the Fiskar mowers, this does have to make contact between the blades and the bottom bar in order for it to make the scissor cut. Therefore, this mower does make some noise, and will definitely have to be tweaked throughout its lifetime to make sure it\u2019s continuously making correct contact. And also seems to not cut quite as well as the Fiskar, but to me, that somewhat makes sense is the Scotts mower is cheaper., Long story short, I would recommend a Fiskar over this, unless you need all 20 inches and want to save a few dollars."

Mattress was comfortable but COLD..i had to put a blanket between mattress and fitted sheet to stay warm. Next morning mattress was low on air. Figured it was because it was stretching. Aired it up 3 mornings in a row. Still going slow. Sprayed it down with soapy water and can not find a leak. Only thing I can figure is that its a small leak in one of the seams.

I also installed it on a 2001 PT Cruser which is not as good a fit but looks great also., On the Equinox, installation is straightforward and obvious but, note that the bottom elastics that fit into each other should be routed (pushed back and down) where the back and bottom meet, at the extreme left and right of this space. Now from the back side of the seat fish out the elastics, and route it so that the elastic band is exactly at the underside of the seat bottom., \"I suggest a minor improvement to the design: The front pocket exposes its white inside after its installed and maybe it would look slightly more pleasing if this part were made of the same material color as the rest.\""

My old, 6 horsepower snapper self propelled mower was no longer functional, and I decided to try this mower, as I have an EGO leaf blower and hedge trimmer., \"Fast and easy to get set up out of the box.  Read the instruction book, charged the battery, and decided to mow the lawn, though it probably didnt need it, just to try the mower out.  With the snapper, mowing my lawn took an hour.  Three flat areas of yard, and two hilly areas between the flat areas.\", I liked the ability to adjust the speed of the self-propelled feature of this new mower.  And while I was getting the mower set up out of the box, I checked the blades underneath and they were sharper that I was accustomed to mower blades being.  The mower cut well, including shaving some evergreen tree roots that were at/above ground level.  The mower also cut, on one pass, a lot of the onion grass that grows in clumps in yards around here.  With the old snapper, it took two or three passes to cut the onion grass., \"This mower is markedly lighter than the old Snapper, and thus easier to use.  I guess in the Spring and Summer, with regular, weekly use, Ill see how this mowers durability holds up.\", As to mowing time, probably as a function of the high(est) speed I was running self-propelled, I was done mowing in about 45 minutes.  And with respect to battery consumption, the battery has five green \"cells\" lit when fully charged.  The mower came with the mulching blade installed;  when I was done mowing, I had two lit green cells left, so ample power in the battery to get my whole yard done., \"Its not a silent runner;  I use my earbuds to listen to music as I mow.  I did the first part of the yard without ear protection, and the motor noise was loud enough to require me to put the volume up on the music.  Counterproductive to make myself deaf listening to too loud music.  So I put on my ear protection to finish the mowing, and they eliminated the motor noise, and allowed me to enjoy my music at a lower volume.\""

But the taste is bad. Not intolerable. Worth it for the benefits. But the first thing that came to mind when I took the first one was that scene in the lion king where simba eats a huge caterpillar or bug of some sort, and his facial expression is that he is all grossed out by the concept of eating it and the actual taste of it... but then his face changes to pleasantly surprised as he realizes that it staved off his hunger., These are the only b complex dissolvable vitamins that I have found that contain everything I need. I searched for hours and I found one that had everything but no folate, then another that had everything but not enough of one or two active ingredients. I was happy to find these and I would probably still take them even if they tasted like total crap because they have everything I\u2019ve been looking for. But, they actually do not taste like total crap. There is an unidentifiable mild gross taste, but it is mixed with a very pleasant strawberry taste in attempts to make it more tolerable I\u2019m sure. And it works to actually make it cover the weird/gross taste up a little bit. All in all, I can bare the taste and will continue to do so; daily, with gratitude. Why? Because I live in a country where I have the means and access to simply order essential nutrients for my body, and have them magically appear on my doorstep within a day or two. When there are so many countries and so many people in the world that are starving and lacking vital nutrients, even lacking clean water, or water at all. And here I am in my nice air conditioned home, not having to leave the comfort of it to have something delivered to my doorstep that has the ability to make me healthier. That being said,I definitely don\u2019t want to be an \u201cungrateful, arrogant American\u201d, complaining about such petty first world problems, like how something that I am blessed to have access to- FOR MY HEALTH- doesn\u2019t taste like frosting or whipped cream."

Also added comments on clicky vs tactile and will include my review on both, \"Went into this with a bit of trepidation because of the low-profile switches.  However, actually found it quite nice to type on.  Also purchased a Drop CTRL at the same time with Halo Trues, and while the feel is obviously totally different, I somewhat prefer the feel of the Logitech key profile and shorter travel.  To be fair, my last mechanical keyboard was a stash of IBM Model Ms that I got rid of almost a decade ago, and most of what Ive typed on since has been low-profile so I am more used to that now.  Since the key-spacing is still standard, the G915 shouldnt require a ton of adjustment for people used to full size keyboards.\", \"That said, this keyboard has some flaws, with the first one being the most significant to me - the secondary legends are not lit.  All the special character keys (like & and *) are simply printed on the keys and do not light.  Since the printing is not high contrast to begin with, this makes them exceptionally difficult to see in the dark.  I have no problem touch typing with the alpha keys, but will glance for the less frequently used special characters, and the lack of lighting is really annoying.  Its also a little confusing for keys where the secondary character is used more commonly than the primary (ex: double quotes, question mark, etc...).\", \"For reference, the lighter of the photos was taken with typical indoor lighting and while you can see the legends they dont exactly stand out.  Under dim lighting, much less with the lights out, theyre effectively invisible.  This is an especially glaring flaw given plenty of other keyboard manufacturers have figured out a simple solution to this - simply print the secondary legend alongside the primary instead of below it, and let them both light up.\", \"Second, this is 2020.  Why in the world did Logitech choose to go with micro-USB instead of USB-C?  Most other new model high end keyboards now have started adopting USB-C.  This was a common complaint on the original G915 as well (along with the lack of lit secondary legends), and its clear Logitech hasnt learned anything from all of the prior feedback.\", \"Third, while the battery life from the lithium battery is great, if Im spending $220 on a keyboard, I dont want to replace it in a few years if the battery starts losing its capacity.  How many of you have had cell phones or laptops that just dont hold a charge as long as they used to?  If you usually use this in wired mode that may be unlikely (since youre not constantly discharging the battery fully), but it would be better if the battery was replaceable.\", \" And, while I might be in the minority for saying so, Id almost rather it use rechargeable NiMH AAs (just throw a couple of Eneloops in it) than a non-replaceable lithium battery.\", \"Finally, I really wish Logitech had went with higher end keycaps.  On a $220 keyboard it isnt outrageous to hope for PBT double-shot keycaps.  While ABS keycaps arent uncommon, at this price point a lot of wired keyboards are now including PBT double-shot keycaps, which feel more solid, wont show oil shine, and wont have legends wearing out.  This and the lack of shine-through secondary legends would be less of an issue if you could replace the keycaps, but its virtually impossible to find third party keycaps in this profile (looks similar to Kailh Choc switches but I dont have a Kailh Choc board to try swapping with).  To be fair theres not a large number of mechanical wireless keyboards to begin with, and most of those are also still using ABS keycaps, so you may be stuck with this regardless (when the Keychron K8 eventually comes out, its keycaps will be ABS but are at least OEM profile and can be swapped out).\", \"Originally there were issues with the software, but Logitech fixed those with a software update made available on release day.  The new software does recognize the keyboard correctly and let you customize the lighting.  You can also adjust things like how long a period of inactivity before the lighting turns off.  Note that you also need the software to set a default lighting mode (for example, the board defaults to all keys lit the same color and gently rotates between colors - I prefer the color wave, but the board wont remember that without the software, and after inactivity defaults back to the original setting).\", \"As for the pluses... As I noted above, its quite comfortable (for me at least) to type on.  Ive apparently come to prefer the light actuation force and short key travel.  The Lightspeed wireless is responsive, simply works (just plug in the dongle - no issues with pairing), and doesnt interfere with my Bluetooth headset, which is a big plus.  If you can get past the unlit secondary legends, the primary legends are attractive and have a very pleasant glow.\", \"Build quality is good and the aluminum top panel is attractive and has a decent heft to it.  The bottom is plastic but seems solid and the keyboard doesnt feel like it has any worrisome flex to it.  The plastic tip-out feet do feel a bit cheap, though they still hold the keyboard without shaking.  At this price point wired keyboards are a lot more robust (the Drop CTRL I also purchased has an aluminum upper and lower, and the feet are also solid aluminum), but thats not really an apples-to-apples comparison.\", \"If youre looking at both the clicky and tactile versions of this keyboard, both felt good to me to type on.  However, the tactile response on the clicky is sharper and more noticeable.  With these low profile switches the tactile version has relatively little feedback when compared to full size tactile switches.  I cant compare it to the linear version, but If youre coming from a keyboard with a significant tactile response, the tactile version of this keyboard is definitely going to be more subtle in comparison.\", The clicky version technically clicks both on the downstroke and on the upstroke.  This isn't that noticeable and isn't at all off-putting.  The key does actuate before the click, but it is close enough that it is imperceptible and is unlikely to affect normal typing (to confirm it I had to push the key down as slowly as I possibly could).  The sound is definitely a \"click\", or \"tick\", not a \"clack\".  Subjectively the Kailh click bar based switches are reported to be a bit higher pitched but crisper than ones based on a click jacket design (like Cherry MX Blues).  The last clicky keyboard I owned was an IBM Model M, which isn't really a fair comparison, and this definitely doesn't scratch that itch for me.  However, as noted above, I found the click gave a slightly better tactile response than the non-clicky tactile version.  Alas, while the keyboard is not that loud, it was still a deal breaker for my wife., \"Unfortunately, the negatives really leave me on the fence with this keyboard.  The Drop CTRL I am also considering is better built, has better keycaps, swappable switches, USB-C, and open source firmware.  If I go with the G915 it will either be because I cant past having an extra wire on my desk (and right now the G915 is probably the best wireless option with backlit keys unless you want to take a chance on a Hexgears Venture) or because I find myself unable to adapt to full height keys anymore after using laptop keyboards for so long.\", If I had suggestions for Logitech:, * Lit secondary legends, * USB-C, * PBT keycaps, * User replaceable battery"

Its very sturdy and feels like its made of high quality plastic. There is no give on any part and nothing flexes when it shouldnt. That being said, it isnt as heavy as it seems. My old mouse is a rat3 which is quite a bit smaller, especially length wise, but about the same weight. For me the problem is this mouse has a long palm part. The rat is tiny and Ive gotten used to something halfway between a claw and fingertip grip which is awkward with how long this mouse is. If you rest your palm on the mouse, this has a nice large curve which is healthier for your wrist. I couldnt ask for more dpi options. I recently learned Im crazy for liking 4.5k dpi (my friends just havent practiced fine fingertip control of the mouse like I have I guess), but the mouse has plenty of options. The software for the mouse is confusing. I spent about an hour hitting random buttons and nothing seems to do what I expect it to (ex. I still cant figure out how to get the leds to just stay on as a solid color). But for the most part you dont need to mess with it to use the different dpi as they come preloaded on the internal memory.\", Moving on the the keypad, there's a huge difference in plastic quality from the mouse. It isn't bad, but it doesn't feel nearly as nice or sturdy. There are rubber feet to prevent slipping which work, but the design also causes a bit of rocking and flex by the thin palm rest. Key travel and responsiveness is good. They have a good actuation force and are tactile tomewhere in-between membrane and mechanical browns. Compared to my strike 3's \"memchanical\" keys (I miss all the old madcatz hardware) it's def more mechanical feeling. Unlike the mouse, the keypad requires no software. You use the alt mode on function keys to control lighting and some other macro like features., \"All in all, Ive definitely used worse hardware that costs double for just one piece compared to this bundle. If you want to save space or get a slightly nicer input for games on a laptop (thats what I use it with) then this is a great affordable deal. Oh and one last thing thats really been bugging me, but isnt actually that big of a deal, is that the USB cords/plugs arent the same! Total missed opportunity to make a nice consistent set out of their products.\""

I\u2019m guessing it was released on April 1. As a cordless weed trimmer, it\u2019s weak. As a high grass trimmer it\u2019s horrible. Why? For the price of $200, from this brand I expected at least it would have some torque. At least enough for high grass. You know, GRASS! Not talking about 1/4 inch stuff. No, I\u2019m talking about grass., Another point here is, TIME. Why do I get only 10-15 minutes of power? I see now why you have us get 2 batteries with this thing now. But what if we\u2019re already using your cordless devices? Where\u2019s the option to get this without the batteries? Most everything else you sell has that option! I already had 12 batteries this size. I didn\u2019t need another 2. Now I have 14 batteries. I don\u2019t have that many hands!!, And that wheeled cart is nice if you\u2019re moving it forward, but the lip lock thing works as good as a v@x when you move it backwards. I haven\u2019t tried fixing this problem yet. Mostly because it\u2019s dumb. But.., ALTERNATIVE USE, Weedy is weed trimmer, Hedgy is hedge trimmer, But I\u2019m not returning it because I found a use for Weedy and cart combo. Listen, this technically only requires the wheeled cart. Do you have a cordless Hedgy? I do. I think it\u2019s the one with the really long cutty part. I discovered that I can lay Hedgy on the front of the cart and it barely touches the wheel. That\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not great. However, if I remove the plastic guard to the cutty part, it can rest on the cart front without touching the wheels. There\u2019s about a half inch gap., The only use for Weedy in this project is to be the handle. I could probably use an old string mop (Moppy) in the Weedy\u2019s place., So here\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll use zip tie to fasten Hedgy\u2019s handle to Weedy\u2019s/Moppy\u2019s shaft. Wrap bungee cords from front of cart to back, maybe under, but definitely over Hedgy to press Hedgy to Carty for better stability. I won\u2019t worry about the cords getting damaged under Carty, because there\u2019s nothing cutting under Carty. Instead, Hedgy will have Cutty off the side at a 90 degree right/left angle. I wish I could put another Hedgy on the back of Carty going off the other side, but it won\u2019t fit. Anyway. Harbor Foot decided that it was 8PM a little after 7PM today, so I wasn\u2019t able to get the zip ties or the bungee cords today. Even though I wanted to test it out today. Maybe I\u2019ll get a chance next week sometime. If it works, I\u2019ll post a pic of the mutated Weedy/Hedgy Brush Trimmer. I\u2019m actually curious how fast it would cut through high grass and young pine trees about 1/4 inch., I wonder if y\u2019all could just sell the cart with that hole in it? Or, better yet, look for a cart with a ribbed hole in it angled for like a push broom. Maybe there\u2019s a way to get 2 Hedhy\u2019s on a cart., After thought: This won\u2019t cut low. At best, the grass will be trimmed to about 4 inches. But, sometimes 4 inches is okay. It\u2019s still better than having it too long. The city will fine me if it\u2019s too long. Grass. I\u2019m talking about grass., Final note (for now): There\u2019s this thing I saw that fits into this make/model trimmer that\u2019s put out by a company with \u201cth\u201d at the beginning. It\u2019s orange. It rhymes with Pigpen. The blades it ships with are flimsy plastic. But there are metal blades from Ali. So I\u2019d probably get the blades from Ali. There\u2019s stainless steel blades which may work with it."

You have to press really hard on the lever inside the cover to get the battery to disengage. It would helpful if the instructions said to press down hard until you hear it click. It just says to press the lever, which I did several times not knowing that you have to press it HARD until you hear it click.  Also, I gave it four stars, not five, for assembly because the handle doesnt attach easily. You have to line it up just right and push and turn the knob just right for it to latch hold of the threads so you can screw it on. One of its selling features is the you can easily store it compactly. I dont think Ill ever be unscrewing the hand to lay is down and then set it up and screw the knobs on again.\", \"Enough of the negative. Onto whats good about the mower.\", I have about a 1/4 acre lot, with a fair amount of lawn that needs mowing. The battery life was plenty to mow the whole yard (with some juice left over) on one charge. The charger isn't lightning fast, but it was pretty quick (you don't have to wait hours for the battery to charge).  I also did not want a small 13\", 14\" or even 17\" mower.  I like my yard to look nice, but I don't enjoy yard work so I want to be able to mow it in under an hour. It took me about 40 minutes because I got the bigger 21\" mower (yes, it costs more, but to me it's worth it)., It was very light compared to my 21\" gas mower.  I did have to test it a bit to get the right speed for me with the self-propelled feature.  The rabbit fast setting was too fast for me -- I was jogging at that speed. The turtle speed was too slow (see earlier comment about wanting to get the lawn mowed in under an hour).  Half-way is what worked best for me, but you have a lot of leeway in between., \"I did read in the reviews before purchasing where others said it takes a few seconds to get going after you start the motor -- true, but its really only a second -- and I read where others talked about the need to disengage the self-propel bar before turning corners and the delay before the wheels stop turning. You do need to let go two steps before you turn for the back wheels to stop turning, but within a couple of passes I was used to its cadence and knew when to let go of the bar.\", \"It cut the grass really well. The adjustability of the height is easy and super convenient. Just pull the green handle on the right side and ALL of the wheels move to the same height; thats a real plus in my book, i.e., not having to adjust the height of each wheel individually.\", \"It does make some noise, but its a lot quieter than a gas mower.\", \"The bag is easy to empty and I like how it blows the grass to the opposite side so the clippings didnt all come back out on the lawn when the bag was full.\", Does it cost more than a 21\" gas mower with similar features, yeah, a bit, but I don't have to buy gas and fill the tank each time. That's a definite plus!, I really like it!"

The height adjustment mechanism seems solid: having the adjustment lever, itself a decent sized metal leaf spring with an oversized plastic handle, secured against large plastic lugs (see included picture). Wheels are of a decent size and fit well\u2014having very little lateral play. Just the simple stuff youd expect in a basic mower, but done well.\", -, Handle is adjustable to 3 different functional heights and has been very comfortable in use so far. It also collapses telescopically in addition to being able to fold forward when not in use, significantly reducing storage size. The handle bar's shape was also a pleasant surprise. The triangular \"hump\" in the center actually seems to help one-handed maneuvering, which is great in combination with this mower's very light weight., -, \"Plenty of power and reasonable deck size (20 inches) make it a fine fit for my small yard (7000 sq ft). Which Ive always finished on a single charge. Assuming battery performance (and the mower itself) lasts a few years, this should be a pretty good deal.\", -----, Positive aspects:,   * It is very light and easy to maneuver, even one-handed.,   * It has sufficient power to handle my yard, even after some neglect\u2014with grass and weeds several inches high.,   * The electric motor is very convenient: always ready to go with no planning ahead, no disposables to stock and requiring no seasonal maintenance., Negative Aspects:,   * Not recommended to leave battery on charger long term, meaning you have to set an alarm when charging and remove battery from the charger yourself. Being a lithium battery with low self-discharge though means you can do this once after each mowing session and still come back to a mostly charged battery the next time you need to mow."

One of the least inexpensive ones I found and before I bought it had better reviews. I had to write one now after I\u2019ve had it for about 7 months. I\u2019ve had NO ISSUES. NONE. I have three cats and this is their only litter box until I purchase a second one for my closet. I say it\u2019s their only litter box because they will not go in their regular ones now only this ONE LITTER BOX! The app tells me they are going between 9-15 times a day\u2026 at this rate after this long I figured I\u2019d have issues and I havnt. I have seen online their customer service is great but I thankfully have not need them. It alarms when full which working 14-16 hour shifts 4 days in a row it\u2019s been life changing for both me and my cats. Even full, I never smelled the box. Two friends came over didn\u2019t even know I had animals. A little noisy but not as noisy as some I\u2019ve online and you can set it to not go off at night if you don\u2019t like it. The noise is not loud enough to wake me up at night either. Do not miss the label on do not push door when unboxing. I did and luckily stopped to look before damaging it. The ONLY, and I mean this, the ONLY issue I have with it is unhooking the claw for cleaning. Bring a pen or knife to help press the clamp down one at a time then pull together. I also have carpal tunnel so others may not have an issue with this. Cleaning is so simple once you get it down. Don\u2019t forget to place the litter box back inside BEFORE adding the litter when you clean it LOL. They send 2 claws which both have been working fantastic. For the price this one is amazing and I will be purchasing a second one. I will hopefully edit with a video."

True story, when my husband opened the bottle he was in the kitchen and I could smell the vitamin 2 rooms away. Quite strong smelling.  Now as to the efficacy of this vitamin.  I only took it twice as I had an extremely hard time swallowing this large tablet, however, on the other hand my husband commented he felt the pill is large but has muscled through it and is now reaping the rewards of having much more energy all within a week and a half of taking this supplement regularly.  So to sum up my review if you are someone who struggles with large pills you might want to skip this product, plus it smells pretty vitamin/minerally which makes your urine EXTREMELY yellow and smelly but definitely will give you more energy.  I personally bought another product for myself which I havent received yet, but I will continue to purchase this brand for my husband as he said he feels tremendously better.\""

Similar to Cherry red., \u2022 Subjectively satisfying typing sound from bottoming out keys., \u2022 Adjustable actuation is a fantastic feature and helps working from home without swapping from a gaming keyboard., \u2022 Backlight looks fantastic, \"\u2022 Software actually isnt all that bad. It gets the job done. Automatic profile switching has thus far been reliable.\", \u2022 Keyboard profile is small enough to not get in the way, unlike some competitors with extended frames and fluff., \u2022 Wrist rest is well made, ,magnetic attachment is convenient., \u2022 OLED screen controls double as limited media controls., \u2022 Not overly heavy., \u2022 Raised / exposed cap design makes it easier to clean., \"\u2022 Subjectively, its just a very good looking product.\", Cons, -----, \u2022 Stock key caps are sub-par for a $200 product. Should have had PBT., \"\u2022 The proprietary switches dont always behave with third-party caps. I swapped out the caps for HyperX Pudding PBT caps and had to put O rings on my space bar and both shift keys to prevent them from getting stuck in a depressed position.\", \"\u2022 The OLED screen is next to useless, unless you dont want to use software profiles. It has some gimmick features, but I would have preferred to ditch it for dedicated lock LEDs or media keys.\", \u2022 No dedicated lock LEDs. Num, scroll, and caps lock are conveyed via the key switch LED, which can throw off your designs and the overall look of the board., \u2022 The scroll wheel and button for the OLED screen are very low quality. They feel stiff and are generally unsatisfying to use. The scroll wheel seems to hang up on some parts of the rotation and move more smoothly on others., \"\u2022 The keyboard feet are low quality and cheap, although 90% of people should not be using them, anyway. Using feet on keyboards forces you to bend your wrists, causing further strain, and I cant for the life of me figure out why so many people do this. Keyboard feet exist to allow you to see the keys better, which is something someone in the market for a $200 keyboard probably shouldnt have trouble with. Off topic...\", \u2022 The angle of the board is rather extreme while using the feet, so this problem is made worse., \u2022 The wrist rest, while well made, is also not very ergonomic. The angle at which it sits is necessitated by the very low profile it offers. A proper wrist rest should be flat and flush to the board and sit higher. It is also not long enough to accommodate my hands, but may be a better fit for someone with small hands. It is being relegated to a drawer and replaced with a soft, large rest., \"\u2022 The wrist rest has a soft texture but is still rather hard. This has pros and cons and is often a preference point, but its usually a bad thing when the rest is poorly angled and fit to your hands, as youre dealing with added pressure and poor ergonomics.\""

Although Ive only been using it for a few weeks, Im genuinely surprised by how much I prefer it over the older-style black hose.\", One notable improvement is the design of the ribs, which run lengthwise instead of circular wrapping. I believe this change enhances its strength and durability. Additionally, with its generous 100 ft length, my previous black hose would seemingly take forever to empty once I turned off the spigot. In contrast, this hose seems to empty a lot quicker, which is a time-saver., Furthermore, the inclusion of the nozzle, holder, and washers with this unit is a definite plus. Overall, I consider this product a winner in my book."

I find that orthopedic devices are normally too small, but I saw some of the reviews and I read the product information that states \"runs large\".  My thigh is 23\" at 6\" above the knee.  So I took a chance and ordered XL.  It's entirely too tight -- I can barely get it on and that's with the velcro unattached.  Especially tight is the calf (19.5\" at 6\" below the knee).  That one will be returned.  I then ordered the 2XL, which arrived yesterday.  I'm wearing it right now but I'll probably take it off soon -- too tight.  I've just ordered the 3XL, maybe that will be better, but if it also cuts off the circulation to my calf I'll have to give up on this product.  Which is a shame, because it provides good support, is well-made and the price is reasonable.  I just can't believe that the designer ignored the calf size., \"When I try the 3XL Ill update this review.  It appears to be a good brace, but right now it just doesnt work for me.\", \"Update on 9/2/23:  Ive been wearing the 3XL off and on for a few weeks.  It definitely provides a lot of support and I notice a big difference going up and down stairs.  The problem is that its very tight, so I cant wear it more than a few hours at a time.  Theres very little difference in size between the XL, 2XL, and 3XL; no way the 3XL is two inches larger in circumference than the XL.  Half an inch is more like it.  It does not appear to have stretched with time.  Id give it five stars if the thing fit comfortably; it loses a star because of the faulty sizing.  I see that they now list a 4XL, but theres no sense in sending for one because I have no confidence it will be any larger than the others.\""

The precision is unmatched, and it leaves your lawn looking like it just stepped out of a gardening magazine.\", \"And lets talk about maintenance \u2013 a breeze!

This is only day one but I will update along my journey. Also note if you are worried about how this supplement could mess with your current medications ask your pharmacist when you pick up your medications they are super helpful!, UPDATE, 2 weeks in, I really like this product, dont care for the taste BUT I do like this. It has been helping me stay up(I have narcolepsy) I have regular medications to help keep me awake. But every time I have tried other medications to add to my normal routine, they have had horrid effects on me. Nuvigial made me awake but with incredible headache pain. So I couldnt sleep away my pain. Provigial made me incredibly depressed, but again awake. Both I couldnt continue to take as the side effects were just too great to continue. Which sucked, so I have been on the narcolepsy subreddit and saw that some have found supplements like these to help. This one so far is helpful, I feel awake and when I work my 12 hour shifts taking this mid day helps me power through the day. I think this wouldnt be as effective if it wasnt for my current daily meds I take but so far it has been an improvement for me. Only downside so far I have noticed is I am slightly more restless and slightly more distracted then usual."

I thought Id really like that keyboard, but I actually disliked it very much. I ended up sending it back today. Why? Well, I was going to live with it, but then yesterday I discovered that Corsair recently re-released this keyboard with Cherry MX Red switches. You can only get it on the official Corsair website at this moment though. Like I said in my original review, I absolutely loved this keyboard and was displeased that I had to let it go, but the Cherry MX Silver Speed switches were just to responsive with 1.2 mm actuation. Cherry MX Red switches have a 2mm actuation. This should suit me much better for not just gaming, but also typing. Im glad to be reunited with this great and awesome keyboard!\", \"ORIGINAL REVIEW: This mechanical keyboard had everything I wanted except one thing - tactile switches. It uses silver speed switches, which are linear and very responsive to the touch. You can barely touch a key and it will be active. This made it great for gaming, but not for typing. I could get used to the typing, and I nearly did, but if you type a lot, there are better options. Outside of that, this keyboard is perfect. I really wish I couldve kept it. It checked all of my boxes for the most part. 1) small form factor being tenkeyless (TKL), 2)  dedicated media buttons, 3) volume control, 4) aesthetically pleasing to the eye, 5) aluminum top plate, 6) great RGB lighting and software, 6) USB type C, and 7) PBT keys! I wouldve also liked if it were wireless and had USB pass-through, but those are optional. The silver speed switches were the deal breaker though. If you seriously game, I highly recommend this. Its flawless. If you are an average gamer, and do a lot of typing and productivity, this isnt for you.\""

I realize this sounds insane and like no one would just keep popping their patella back into place every time it goes out for 21 years, never seeking further medical attention for the issue, especially as it continued to happen with increasing frequency. Its now at the point where it pops out at least once every month or two. Well, I have never claimed to be sane, and in my defense, the doctor I saw for the original injury said that I dislocated it so hard that it left permanent grooves in the cartilage underneath, and because of that, they would act as tracks and it would just keep dislocating, but there was nothing to be done for it. If you are wondering why I didnt seek a second opinion, its because he was the second opinion...\", \"Anyway, on to the brace... My knee has finally gotten so bad that I cant let it go any longer and am going to see an orthopedist again. Im pretty sure the soft tissue is so damaged that its virtually useless. I have tried almost every style of brace on the market (except the really expensive ones), and none of them have offered enough support in the right places and been comfortable to wear for any period of time... But then I found THIS brace!! I hadnt even realized how much pain my knee was constantly in until I put this brace on!\", 1) The inner silky sleeve which protects your leg from rubbing on the outer fabric, and is also breathable and moisture wicking is a complete game changer! One would think such a small detail would be insignificant, but in terms of comfort and wearability it makes all the difference in the world!, 2) The outer fabric is thinner and more light weight than most neoprene braces, making it more slim and comfortable, while still providing good compression and support. Also, the entire outside can be used to stick the velcro to, thus allowing you to position the straps exactly where you need them to be for optimal support., 3) The 2 extra patella support bands are AMAZING!!! They work far better than I ever could have imagined at keeping everything in alignment, and applying just enough pressure to give stability and relieve pain, without being too tight or uncomfortable, as they are fully adjustable., \"4) The side supports are great! They definitely offer necessary added stability. The brace does limit your range of motion some, but thats really the whole point of a brace, since too great of movements will only lead to further injury and damage of an already weak or hurt area.\", \"Hands down, this the the absolute best brace ever!!! The price isnt much higher than your generic designs, and it is well worth it! (Also, I visited the retailers store and received a 25% off coupon to use on Amazon for any of their products, so that was helpful). But even at full price its worth it. No other brace is designed quite as well, or offers the special features this one does. Plus, it is from a small business in the UK, designed by a guy determined to make a brace which would assist him with his own knee problems. The thought and care that went into making it is really evident, from construction to fit and function. It also comes with a 12 month warranty, and they send a paper with their contact info encouraging anyone who has an issue for any reason to contact them for resolution. They seem to be a good company who truly cares about their products and helping people. I very highly recommend that anyone with knee issues get this brace.\", \"The only suggestion I would make is for them to also make this in a plus sized version. Last year a medication I was put on caused A LOT of very rapid weight gain. Happily, stopping the med has reversed the process. But, had I tried to get this brace last year, it would not have fit my leg. Heavier people tend to have more joint problems, but there is a serious lack of good, affordable plus sized options of braces. I strongly encourage this company to fill that need. I am going to write to them regarding this issue. If you get this brace, or if you are a plus sized person whom this brace will not fit, I suggest that you also write to the company regarding this issue. Im sure if enough people do it they will see there is a need and will work to fill it.\", Thank you for reading my long winded review. I hope you found it to be helpful., \"Once more for good measure... BUY THIS BRACE!!! (you wont regret it).\", Namaste."

I was diagnosed with neuropathy.  Lately it has become quite painful in the knee area as well, which makes movement for me hard at times while I am working or at home.  I have tried a few other knee compression sleeves /wraps/ braces and nothing has helped give me the support or motion that helps to reduce the pain like these do.,  As soon as I received these knee compression sleeves, I took out of the packaging and put them on.  These sleeves stay put where I place them, they give me the needed support and allow me to move my knees better while helping to alleviate the pain.  They are of a sturdy quality and are comfortable for me to wear for quite some time each day. Just the right amount of thickness as well.  My items had no strange odor and appear to be an item that would clean easily when the time arises., \"They come with a handy little instruction manual as well.  They do have their precautions listed as well which is helpful as with any treatment, remedy is advisable through your physician to help make sure will not cause further complications for you.  I know I made the right decision in this purchase and greatly appreciate this sellers help with my questions and in getting the correct size for me. Great quality and pricing.\""

Easy to swallow and no issues with me at all., FILLING, These are filled with bright orange powder.  That means when you take them you may burp up a bit of B complex taste, and your urine will be a bright yellow at some point- all very common with B Complex supplements., DO THEY HELP?, Not only do these help with stress, but they help with excess water in the system, so you will be urinating a bit more at first as it balances out your system.  They are not super high potency so they are not overwhelming to the system., THE BOTTOM LINE, These seem like a solid B Complex supplement.  They are not ultra high potency, but they do help with stress and water balance in the body., MY RATING, FIVE STARS.  I am having a decent experience with these and am glad to have them."

I believe this is my 5th mower., What you need to know, is that each version got easier to use, and has been engineered to use less materials, and weighs less, and therefore feels cheaper.  (This newer Model still mows the same lawn, but it\u2019s easier to maneuver because it weighs less. ) The power seems the same, but it\u2019s a little quieter. The battery is easy to change and charge. It has an onboard storage location for an extra battery. The mower doesn\u2019t have to be stored near an electrical outlet, as it uses a simple charger.  Downside of this model is that it takes 4 batteries to mow the lawn that the previous model did with a single charge. The mower came with only 2 batteries., I mow my St. Augustine and Fescue lawn every week keeping weeds to a minimum. I do not mow the lawn when it\u2019s wet. The mower will not handle it. Sometimes, during the Spring, I have had a large flush of growth, and I mow it twice in a week to avoid over taxing the mower.  This mower doesn\u2019t have the power of a gas mower. If you need to mow weeds and tall grass, this isn\u2019t the mower for you.  The bag is the same size and quality of all the previous models, but is not interchangeable., I find it frustrating that It takes 3-4 batteries to mow my lawn, which is about 3500 SF.  There is not much to go wrong with the mower, as long as it\u2019s used for the purpose intended.  If it does, the service center may be able to help, but, they are not a lawnmower shop, and lawnmower shops don\u2019t service this model."

This luxury pro litter box has truly made life with multiple cats a breeze., \"One of the standout features is the ability to detect and recognize different cats. The Catlink App not only allows me to keep track of each cats toilet usage but also provides valuable insights into their health, including weight monitoring. Its like having a personal cat health assistant right in my pocket!\", The App control and data reports are a game-changer. I can access a 24-hour record, a 7-day/12-month health report, and even manage the litter box remotely. This has been incredibly convenient, especially for a multi-user household. The fact that multiple users can share a single litter box seamlessly is a testament to the thoughtful design of CATLINK., \"Safety was a top concern for me, and CATLINK has nailed it. The litter boxs radars, infrared sensors, and anti-pinch features ensure maximum safety. It immediately stops running if it detects a cat, providing peace of mind. The robust, vented design adds an extra layer of security, and the smart illumination is a thoughtful touch for elderly cats with poor eyesight.\", The various clean modes - Auto, Manual, Timer, and Empty - offer flexibility, and the option for both panel and remote app control is fantastic. The Do Not Disturb mode has been a lifesaver for creating a tranquil environment for my cats, and the panel lock prevents any accidental touches from curious pets or children., \"The size of the litter box is just perfect for my multiple cats, with a generous 57L globe capacity and a 13L waste drawer capacity. The warning about suitable cat weights and litter levels is a thoughtful touch, emphasizing CATLINKs commitment to the safety and well-being of our feline friends.\", The double odor removal system with a rechargeable odor purifier and carbon filter is a game-changer. It effectively eliminates unpleasant odors, formaldehyde, and ammonia, keeping my home smelling fresh and clean., \"The CATLINK Automatic Self Cleaning Cat Litter Box has simplified my life as a cat parent. Its not just a litter box; its a sophisticated, intelligent companion that prioritizes the health and well-being of my cats. If youre a cat owner, especially with multiple feline friends, investing in the CATLINK Luxury Pro is a decision you wont regret. Its truly a luxury for both you and your beloved cats!\""

Have purchased two! I will likely purchase two more!!  I have tried MANY automatic cat litter boxes in the past and they were, each and every one, horrific to use, troubleshoot, and clean.  These just work! The first one I purchased just after Christmas as I was about to have a major surgery that was going to make cleaning the cat box an issue. I removed the packing material, plugged it in, and it just worked. No fiddling with settings, no figuring out how to get it to work, just cats go in, do their business, and 3 min later the drum rotates and the mess gets rolled to the top , a weighted flapper opens, and the waste falls into the bag. As the drum returns back to starting position, the weighted flapper over the waste area closes off the trash and keeps all the noxious smells contained! Amazing. There was a tiny issue with the second one, during shipping one of the plastic pins that holds the garbage flapper door in place broke (totally a shipping issue not a manufacturer issue at all). They sent a replacement flapper door part. A single screw needed to be removed and the the part replaced\u2026took less than two min to complete. I filled it with litter, plugged it is, and it to also just worked!  The company was very apologetic that the item did not arrive in perfect condition and they shipped the replacement part by FedEx and it was in my hands in two days. I cannot say enough positive things bout how easy they made this fix!  Needless to say, this company makes an excellent product, stands behind it when something goes wrong, and has made my life having three cats and recovering from surgery SO MUCH EASIER!"

They had the right idea with the thin nylon at the back for comfort, unfortunately, the back fastening design, especially when combined with the board like structure of the front, either requires 4 hands, or significant pain and struggling. I almost gave up at this point, but Im quite stubborn, and was determined to at least put it fully on once. And that is exactly what I did. As soon as I got the outer straps wrapped and fastened, I sat for a second, then immediately had to rip it off because it was causing so much pain and pressure on my kneecap that it was unbearable. For ACTUALLY GOOD patella support, I highly recommend the Exous Body Gear knee brace. It is comfortable, well made, and gives good solid support without being bulky (or causing additional pain!) Ive tried many different brands and designs over the years, and that is hands down my favorite. Good luck to your knees!\""

Even after measuring my thigh like it asks, it was too loose at the top and I found myself constantly having to pull it up., I did like the support it gave on the sides on my knee and would have kept wearing it had it fit properly at the top as it was comfortable.

Its not easy to wrap your head around, but fortunately there are websites like knowyourgenetics.com and mthfr.net that can bring some clarity to its importance as it relates to health. Nutrigenomics is a field thats partly about using targeted supplementation protocols to address mutations in and individuals DNA. The mutations associated with/referred to as MTHFR are very common, occuring in approx. 40% of the population. If you get the DNA testing for it (and other SNPs) and have one or a pair of the two mutations associated with MTHFR, it means your methylation pathyway is running at a reduced efficiency (only 30% efficient if you have two). Specifically, the inability to convert Folic Acid into Folate restricts your bodys ability to get B-vitamins needed for a lot of important stuff, not the least of which is the identification/elimination of ubiquitous toxins and heavy metals, which will gradually accumulate/hide in your body. Even hair tests often do not detect them as they are bound up somewhere. The symptoms associated with these chronic neurotoxins are those experienced in generalized categories of auto-immune diseases. The new science of nutrigenomics, in this case, addresses the genetic mutations in your DNA to allow your body to function properly, get vitamins, and eliminate these neurotoxins. An oversimplification, of course.\", \"Proper dosing/balance depends on the individual, so its recommended to ramp up slowly on methylfolate and under the guidance of a doctor familiar with the protocols. I should add that most doctors will either have no knowledge of, or dismiss it as having no clinical significance. The release of dead cells and toxins built up in your system may be accompanied by some side effects for a little while. Ive taken two of these a day and never had any negative issues. On the positive side, I do feel better, but its too soon to associate it with the improved methylation. But, as someone with homozygous MTHFR results whos taken the time to research it, I know how important it is.\""

I bet that will shrink when you feel how easy this device is to use. Just make sure to charge your batteries after each use, storing them at full capacity and plug them in for a quick boost before use just in case some juice drained while it was stored., Enjoy & Have fun with your new yard toy.

Nonetheless, I eventually purchased this mattress as it was one of the few that was made in America., My apprehension was further heightened when the mattress was delivered in such a small and relatively light box. . . . . . ., Am I impressed - in too many ways ! ! !, I purchased a Queen size fro my buddy who is 6\u20194\u201d and he can fully out comfortably.  One of the many great things about this mattress is that the top is approx. 21\u201d above the floor, which is almost 2 feet. This is a huge benefit when anyone over 50 years old needs to lie down or get up. Another attribute is the firmness of mattress without being \u201chard\u201d, and the ability to adjust the overall firmness by fine tuning the overall inflation., The built in pump is very impressive- as are the SIMPLE and easy to use controls. The built in power cord is adequate in length and is easily stored within the small trap door., Although we will never approach the rated capacity of 600 Lbs., we are very confident of the durability of this mattress. I am not surprised with the other owners who state that their Englander inflatable mattress feels better than their own conventional mattress., This mattress is an OUTSTANDING example of many great design features, quality materials and build, at a most respectable price point., I could not be more pleased with this great purchase. This will remain a valuable long term investment for our household."

My husband and I thought it was exceptionally comfortable and felt great after using it.  Through the years, all of our guests who used the mattress have raved about it and my son-in-law said it was the best air mattress he had ever used.  The best testament as to how comfortable this bed really is:  my sister-in-law used the mattress last week and loved it so much that she took it home with her!  So, I just ordered a replacement exactly like it.  The price has increased (as expected) since 2013 but it\u2019s worth every penny and more.  This is one of my best buys - ever - from Amazon and I buy a lot!!!  Also important to note - This bed is extremely easy to sit down on and stand up from due to it\u2019s height.  It\u2019s also folds up easily and compactly for storage and transportation."

Their doctor recommended that as they are continuing to grow to try compression sleeves when the issue flares up for them to give some support and hopefully decrease any pain.  My teen says these were comfortable and supportive, but that they can slip slightly on your knee sometimes which requires you to readjust them back into place.  They do provide support and relief during flare ups of their knee issues.  Given that this comes with two, you can be covered if both knees are acting up at the same time, which my teen has had happen!  Overall, these seem to help with their knees and allow them to continue participating in their sports with support and less pain.  Thank you for reading this review and we hope you found it helpful!"

I have to manually clean the box practically every time it is used.  The automatic system does NOTHING to remove the waste.

I thought it was because of the hollowness of the board and the \"foam\" provided is supper thin so basically useless. I tried foam and 2 layer tape mod as well ass different switches and keycaps but it still had the pinging I didn't like otherwise the mods did help the sound of the board a lot. its a good starter board but for $50 and $20 in mods u might as well purchase a board of higher quality and sounds nicer(subjective but I think wed all agree). board functions as its supposed to and the rib effects are easy to change and manipulate without software which is a plus.  switches feel good and stabilizers had no rattle, ive heard reviews say the stabs are rly bad but tbh they're rlly good imo. keycaps are light and add to the hollow sound of the board thicker caps helped a lot but the metal plate still pings. didi I mention. epic gamer rgbs supper bright and again the fact u don't need software to change it makes it much simpler, but the keycaps are a little clutters subsequently., \"conclusion: goo board to start modding and go all out, if you j want a MK w RGB theres better choices.\""

Other instructions besides basic height adjustment and pushing to cut grass, all went over my head., I got this model bc it has 7 blades. I live in S. Florida and have mixed grass ( mostly St Augustine and Bermuda).  The handle is not adjustable, so if you are over 5 ft or so, it will be uncomfortable to use. I used it on small, uneven grounds where there were scattered tall grass and it did skip some tall grass. The blades are sharp, easily cut the grass and it was easy to push around., OTHER information- for installation I wore gloves to avoid getting cut; putting on the handle to base is a bit challenging - still lost the E screw. It\u2019s a bit on the heavier side., This is a small reel manual mower. Be realistic about expectations. It produces no pollution, easy to store, decent price and cuts grass."

It received great reviews but was pricy and meant for gaming.  I decided to take the chance and have been very happy with my purchase.  The design is very low profile and a sold piece of equipment and art all in one.  So low low profile that a wrist rest is not necessary., Battery is long lasting as long as you remember to turn it off.  I can get a month or more on one charge using it 5+ days a week for over 8hrs a day., The back lighting is great and love that I can change the colors.  Macro keys are the bomb and cut down on repetitive key stokes., Speed, every bit as fast as it says it is.  I was unsure how responsive this would be. Well not to worry, no drag., The keys are well spread out and make it easy to type.  The sound is so satisfying with each tap., I took one star away for a few reasons:  First, the keyboard doesn\u2019t allow for syncing your mouse.  Second, there is not an indicator for number lock. Lastly, every now and then, when typing the board will \u201chiccup\u201d and repeat a letter until I stop typing.  Usually an indicator for a charge., Besides those downfalls I am still in love and super satisfied with my keyboard."

The first reel mower I owned was a Fiskars StaySharp 18\", and that thing was a champ. It barely choked on anything, sticks or stones, and handled damp grass with ease, which was a major plus while mowing over my rocky soil in Washington State., I got rid of that mower when I moved for lack of space in the trailer, but now wish I tried harder to find room. I replaced it with this mower because of the 20\" cutting width, figuring it would save me a bit of time over the Fiskars, but after one mow I realized I was wrong. This mower is inferior in every way., It gets clogged frequently by even small pieces of mulch that inevitably find their way into the yard, slowing me down as I have to stop and clear the blades., \"Its more difficult to push, and its easy to lift the wheels off the ground. If the wheels arent spinning, the blades arent turning, which means the grass isnt getting cut. I have to really exert a downward force on the mower to make sure the wheels and blade spin. I didnt have to worry about this with the Fiskars.\", \"The build quality is suspect. As the title of this post says, one of the little wheels fell off on the second mowing because a bolt rattled loose. This wheel comes assembled in the box, and I didnt expect Id need to inspect and tighten bolts before every mow. I certainly didnt have to on the Fiskars, which overall seemed like a more solidly built mower.\", The Fiskars also offers a higher cut of 4\" compared to 3\" on this thing, and the blade adjustment is easier on the Fiskars., \"I didnt realize how good I had it with the Fiskars until I bought this mower. Instead of putting the wheel back on, Im going to write off this as scrap metal and buy a new Fiskars.\""

While it may not be the perfect fit for every cat owner, its particularly attractive for those seeking a low-maintenance option that can remain untouched for weeks.\", \"To begin with, I initially opted for the PetSafe ScoopFree Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box. As an affordable entry-level option, it utilized crystal litter and a rake to shift waste horizontally into a dedicated waste area. However, I faced recurrent expenses and subpar results. My reliance on the proprietary litter trays meant each refill set me back $20. Given that two cats consumed one tray every two weeks, costs quickly accumulated. Additionally, the crystal litter struggled with urine absorption, becoming ineffective at containing odors. If one of my cats had diarrhea, the rake would inadvertently scatter fecal matter, complicating matters further. This led me to explore Popurs litterbox.\", \"Popurs design is straightforward. It boasts a spacious litter area, reducing the frequency of refills. The gentle rake and a tilt mechanism channel waste into a separate external bin. Notably, this external bins generous capacity means infrequent bag replacements. With my two cats, I only need to change the waste bag every 2-3 weeks. Occasional deep cleans and litter refills round off the maintenance. For a genuinely time-saving automatic litterbox, Popurs model ticks all the boxes.\", \"Cost remains a significant consideration. I sought a solution without recurring commitments akin to my experience with PetSafe. While the initial $399 might seem steep, its a more economical choice than Whiskers LR4. Long-term savings come from minimal upkeep costs\u2014primarily litter and replacement bags. Given that litter purchases are inevitable, only the bag expenses are incremental. After a year of usage, Ive noticed substantial savings compared to my previous setup.\", \"However, the product isnt without its reliability issues. The primary rotating mechanism, responsible for waste disposal, has been consistent. Yet, the lids hinge, vital for accessing the waste bin, has been problematic. Issues range from misaligned position detection to total failure. The accompanying app, crucial for customizing the devices functions, has its quirks. Frequent resets and re-pairings have been necessary. The recent app outage, affecting all users, was particularly disappointing given its essential role in providing usage notifications. Furthermore, after a year, noticeable creaks have developed, necessitating frequent lubrication\u2014a maintenance task Id hoped to avoid.\", \"In conclusion, despite occasional frustrations, Popurs litterbox stands out for its innovative design. While its not flawless, it remains my go-to solution for its overall functionality and convenience.\""

I switched from the petsafe scoop free and that did a pretty poor job with odor control after a few days so decided to switch to this. Even with some users having leaking problems, I haven\u2019t had any so far. I use this WITH crystal litter and have had no issues. I fill it up a lil past max line and the crystal litter fully coats the poop before going into the poop shoot lol. The only con I have is that sometimes the barrel jitters while working - like it will sound like it\u2019s coming off track, but does not seem to hinder them performance.

The build quality is great, well above what youd expect at this price point. Im a taller guy so I didnt find the wrist guard to be very helpful (it doesnt extend very far beyond the keys) but the keyboard is comfortable enough without it. Keys feel strong, not loud, with enough bounciness to make me recognize it will likely handle plenty of wear and tear.\", The lights were suppose to be just a fun little perk on top, but they're actually quite beautiful, not too bright (I can have it on in my room with almost no lights on it and doesn't blind me) and they help illuminate the keys if you ever get lost on the home row (which has happened fairly often since this keyboard elevates the keys differently than my old one). I would highly recommend this as a very capable \"basic\" keyboard that feels/looks more expensive than it is."

So I wanted to get a mechanical keyboard with macro keys on the left side. Once I saw this had onboard memory, and that the equivalent mechanical keyboard with left side macro keys (that did not have onboard memory) was $180, I decided to give this one a try instead., Pros:, Little squishy feeling at first, but easy to get used to., Macro keys are in the perfect place., \"Onboard recording is sweet, although I dont use it much and wouldnt pay more for it now that Ive had the option and see I dont use it much.\", Colors are nice, Software lets you reprogram any key and recording macros is easy plus you can add mouse clicks., Cons:, \"Software. While it is possible to make all kinds of macros and save profiles, the way it saves the macros is weird and its very easy to overwrite them. Its also hard to figure out how to clear a macro from a key when you want it to go back to unprogrammed (you have to go to single key like you want to map it to a different key and just leave it blank - I had problems figuring this out at first and emailed the company and they had no idea what I was talking about).\", \"You cannot use the REC key to record macros on a key that has a software macro enabled. It would be nice if you could and it would temporarily disable that specific key in the software macros.  You also cant save anything in the onboard memory unless it is currently mapped so its not possible to make different profiles without actually creating the macros in the software itself (instead of just hitting REC). Once you clear it it is gone and you will have to record it again.\", \"Overall I am very happy with this purchase. I just wish I could save the manually recorded macros somehow (different profiles with a switch on the keyboard would be nice) because as it is I have very little use for the onboard macros since I would have to reprogram my defaults over and over if I were to change them on the fly. Still beats AHK if I need to just make them hit a certain amount of tabs and spaces or whatever for a certain task. Just clear the profile in the software and REC with the onboard key. Voila. For under $40 I think its a great purchase. I also ended up getting the same brand macro mouse. I <3 automation.\""

If you really, truly want OEM fit, you will shell out $200+ for fitted seat covers. Reupholstering is insanely expensive. That said, if you take a couple hours to carefully install these, you will get a nice, even fit. Dont force them and take your time working the covers over each seat.\", I have a 2006 Hyundai Elantra with dated and faded OEM seats, so this set provided a wonderful face lift for the interior. I did not know what to expect (given some negative reviews), but I am more than pleased by how they look and feel., \"Again, do NOT force them over the seats and take your time gently stretching the material to fit your seats contours. No stitch will withstand brute force.\", Also, if you have a rear bucket seat that folds down to give you trunk access, I recommend not using the latches for easier access. There are convenient zippers in bucket seat cover that allow you to detach the one-piece cover so that you can drop the backrest. Simply use your hands to slide the cover underneath and behind the seats and they hold in place quite well., In short, if you are looking to improve the look of your interior without spending hundreds of dollars, this set is a great choice."

Our cats are still getting used to it for the most part. We have 5 cats, 2 of them use the machine but they only urinate in it for now.  4 of our cats are male and they are large at between 15 and 20 pounds. They fit in the litter box part of the machine but just barely. They sit in it with their heads toward the back of the machine and their hind end in one corner at the front. I think it would be better if they learned to turn around so their head is at the front but not sure how to accomplish that.  Im thankful they are only urinating at this point because with how they are situating themselves, if they defecate in that position, it might not be inside the litter box.  Hopefully they will figure it out and all will go smoothly. The machine works as expected. The machine itself is relatively quiet when cleaning out the litter but the plastic trash bin that we upgraded to instead of the cardboard is more noticeably loud. The opening and closing of the lid that is done when the machine is emptying the waste is louder than the machine itself. I do like that the machine levels out the litter when its done cleaning. It works mostly well but does leave the last three inches or so of the liner with the litter mounded up like a sort of cliff of litter. I just take the included plastic shovel and level out the last bit myself. Still much better than cleaning the litter out as that is a task I absolutely hate doing. Oh, we use a mixture of 75% Sustainably Yours litter and 25% Dr. Elseys in case anybody needs a reference.  The machine doesnt have any issue filtering out the waste from the litter and the grate that filters the waste and then smooths out the litter when all is cleared out doesnt have any issue with the litter we use. My only real complaint is the app associated with the machine.  It is a hassle to get connected at first and for the first couple of days it was throwing errors back and was disconnecting from the machine.  After that, the app has worked smoothly thus far. All in all, I think this was a great purchase.\""

Cut the lawn much faster than the previous mower.  The self-propelled feature feels awkward.  The self-propelled control mechanism is a finger pincher between primary and secondary handles.  The self-propelled drive wheels have hard plastic tires that provide very poor traction.  Lots of wheel spin and failure to reverse for backing up.  Two batteries, 4.0 Ah, ran out of juice when 80% done in good dry mowing conditions.  Lucky I have extra batteries.  This thing is a keeper.  Practice will bring better skill with the self-propelled function.  Need to find a way to add traction on the drive wheels."

I use this calf wrap as a knee wrap support. It is elastic and stretchy but very supportive for my painful arthritic knee.  Its 71 inches long, so its almost 6 feet long. I fold it in half to be about 36 inches long and then I can still wrap it 3 or 4 times around my knee. I start the wrap slightly below my knee and continue to wrap until its about 2 inches above my knee. And like magic it takes away about 75% of my knee pain and weakness.  Im still trying to strengthen my knees so I eventually will not need this wrap as support.  But for now its great.\", \"Ive even wrapped it around my painful hips for support, it wrapped twice around.\", I plan to order at least one more."

Primarily, lack of power to cut thick parts of my yard.  Next was battery life., \"Now Im so glad I made the jump!  This thing is amazing.  I ran some experiments in my yard and kept lowering the deck (which is so easy to do with the one lever, versus doing each wheel individually) to see if it would bog down where my old gas mower always did.  This mower never flinched.  Ran right through the thick parts of my yard with no issues at all.\", \"The battery easily lasted for my full yard.  I think Ill actually be able to get two or three mows done on one battery charge based on how much juice its telling me I have left.  With my gas mower, I could get two.\", Compared to the gas mower, this one is very quiet.  I could have conversations with my family while running it without really raising my voice.  You can also use the self-propelled feature without having the blade on, which is a nice feature not possible with a gas mower., The handle height adjustment is really easy to use as well.  I was able to easily drop the handle height and mow under a trampoline.  The variance of heights offered are greater than what my previous mower had., Two other big perks:  This mower is much lighter than a gas mower, so maneuverability is much easier.  Second, you can fold this up and store it upright between uses.  Not really something you can do with a gas mower., The only real worry that remains for me is how long the battery will last over time and be able to hold a full charge.  But, with a five year warranty, that worry is really not all that big a concern for me., \"I had my doubts, but I can honestly say, using this mower, this was the happiest Ive ever been mowing the lawn.\""

It will stop working for no earthy reason because of a sensor detection error\u2026 and it cannot reset on its own\u2026you may not even know anything is wrong until it\u2019s too late., It\u2019s been 2 weeks of cat chaos., The minimal directions and troubleshooting are in poorly written English., 1. We followed the directions, downloaded the app, set up pet profiles with their weight and photos., This was pointless as there is no distinction as to which cat was using the box, just a generic alert that the box was cleaned. During the transition this information would be helpful in a multi cat house. I found out later that one skittish cat was NOT using it and went in other places. Would have been nice to find out sooner\u2026but the app didn\u2019t help with that., 2. The device isn\u2019t loud, but it makes a noticeable mechanical churning sound that takes the cats some time to get used to and may scare them at first., 3. The device would sometimes drop an extremely large amount of clean litter in the disposal bin $$$., This would happen in the automatic cleaning cycle based on a timer., 4. Odor control really depends more on the type of litter you use and the device deodorizer wasn\u2019t that effective. A better seal around the tray would help., 5. There is a motion sensor that will stop the device from cleaning if a cat or motion is detected. This is a great safety feature but curious Cats can keep making the device stop unexpectedly. It takes them time to get used to the motorized sounds., This is the crux of the major design and functionality problem: the sensor and the software has a design flaw. The removable bottom waste tray is located  close to the unprotected motion sensor at the bottom front of the device., The base assembly that houses the sensor is left open at the bottom when it probably should be enclosed to prevent litter dust and debris from interfering with the sensor., Remember this device slowly spins the litter in a barrel (like a cement truck ) sifting it through a filter to remove waste, this creates dust and even some litter may come out of the front - sometimes this happens from the cats use also. A small annoyance, but not a big deal., After a few solid days of use including automatic cleanings, twice I discover that the device is locked in the upside down position, light flashing red , unusable to the cats, cat poop on my carpet , becuase they have no place to go\u2026. The worst part: I didn\u2019t get an error message so I had no idea until the morning. So irritating and I felt so bad for my confused cats., I go the reset it:. Alert and Red Flash., I remove the litter : Alert and Red Flash, Power down and on: Alert and Red Flash., I disassemble and completely clean it : Alert and Red flash, All locked in the upside down position. It won\u2019t move., Unusable for the cats., Factory Reset., Totally inexplicable frustration., All systems go after reset., 4 days of no problems., Wake up on day 5., Stuck in upside down position, unusable., Cat poop everywhere because they have no place to go. Repeat steps above., No error message on the app. Everything looks fine., Rinse and repeat the same thing to total disassemble and factory reset again\u2026., 2 days of working., And\u2026 you guessed it\u2026, Same thing again., I\u2019m so frustrated with expensive \u201ccheap\u201d products that\u2019s cannot do the one simple thing they are supposed to do. My advice is to hire a cat sitter because these \u201cintelligent\u201d cat devices are pretty dumb. It literally had ONE job., If you order this one you may end up coming home to a big mess and your app won\u2019t even let you know., Your cats will be pretty confused., To the company that makes this,, This device needs the following:, - More video directions and troubleshooting online., - A better troubleshooting manual., - A software update that shows usage by cat profile., Why bother having cat profiles with photos, names, breed and weight, for there to be no distinction as to which cats are using the device, just a generic \u201cautomatic cleaning complete\u201d\u2026.Please Update the software, guys., - a sensor enclosure to protect to better from dust., - a way to remotely override errors and force reset., - better app alert notification when out of position., - a side removal option for waste tray., - the default litter position should always be DOWN  in the usable position, similar to an elevator during a fire alarm: they all go to the lobby. That\u2019s a software fix. It should never be stuck in the upside down position and unusable. Especially if you don\u2019t even get an alert., - Hire a better English speaker to write your manuals., Everyone, Just be very careful using this and not monitoring it closely. Your poor kitties will be confused and stressed and you\u2019ll be cleaning floors in frustration."

Right off the bat, the setup process was straightforward, apart from a minor hiccup with the WiFi connection which took a few tries to get right. But once connected, the convenience it offers is unparalleled., The automatic cleaning feature has transformed our routine. No longer do I need to scoop litter multiple times a week. Instead, I receive notifications on my phone when it\u2019s time to refill the litter or when the trash bin is full, which is incredibly handy. The app also allows me to monitor how frequently my cats use the litter box, giving me peace of mind about their health and habits., My cats adapted quickly to their new bathroom, and they seem to love it as much as I do. The automatic cleaning doesn\u2019t startle them, and the litter box is always clean for the next use, which I think they appreciate., The only challenge was the initial WiFi setup, requiring several attempts before successfully connecting. However, this small effort is a minor inconvenience compared to the benefits. This litter box is a game-changer, significantly reducing the time and effort spent on litter box maintenance., In conclusion, the Catlink Self-Cleaning Automatic Litter Box is an excellent investment for cat owners who value convenience, hygiene, and the well-being of their furry friends. It\u2019s easy to use, efficient, and the smart features add an extra layer of oversight that\u2019s very reassuring. Highly recommended!"

I read that Vitamin B can help settle down TN. I tried cheaper B complexes, but they upset my stomach, caused headaches, a LOT of burping, etc. I have experience with Nordic Naturals because I take fish oil, so even though these are pricey, I gave them a try. Within a week my tongue was a lot less sensitive, and my mouth started to calm down. I did get one small lesion after eating salty food, but after a couple hours it simply went away., It has now been one month of taking Nordic Naturals B complex, and I really am much better. I still have to avoid inflammatory foods, of course, but this B complex is indispensable. I must also take a sub-lingual B12 vitamin, and if Nordic made those I would buy from them. My one complaint is the very high price for just 45 capsules, but at the same time I agree that the quality is better than that of competitors., I am also hoping that if I take these regularly for several months, that the symptoms will go away entirely. My mouth is so sensitive that even dental work (teeth cleaning) causes blister to form. If I get through my next check-up with no reaction, plan to update this review."

Basically it involves a rotating drum (much like a clothes dryer) with an entry port in the front of the appliance. The cat enters, does its business, and then (if all goes well) the drum will rotate after a user-set amount of time after the cat exits. The mechanical portion is a very simple design, actually. When the drum rotates, it first dumps the litter through a sifting grate and into a holding compartment. As it continues to rotate, the sifted- out clumps roll into a chute and into a plastic bag-lined waste bin, which is easily removed for periodic emptying. The drum then rotates in reverse, with the litter dumping back through the grate, and back to the starting point. Done, and ready for the next use\u2014and all very quietly. After a week, at least one of our two ragdoll cats, probably both (although it\u2019s still to early to tell), are using it., I would suggest using a lightweight clumping litter with this machine. On first setting it up, I put in our usual clay clumping litter, which is pretty heavy\u2014this stalls the drum, preventing it from going through its full rotation and dumping the clumps. I scooped some litter back out, and lightened up, it worked perfectly. The drawback was that after removing some of the litter, what remained was below the fill line. With a lighter litter it should be possible to fill it all the way up to the line and not stall the rotation due to the weight., The box includes a UV light feature for sterilization. You can initiate it via the app, or turn on \u201csmart sterilization\u201d in Setup. I can\u2019t yet comment on how well this works, Manual operation is very simple. There\u2019s a button on the front of the box, and a single press sends it through a cleaning cycle. Two presses causes it to dump all the litter into the plastic waste bag for disposal., The app itself seems to work, although it is a bit rudimentary. It is supposed to log the number of visits and average time of visits, but so far this isn\u2019t working even though it\u2019s evident that a cat has used it at least a few times. DND mode can be switched on or off, but I have no idea what it does. You can remotely run the box through a cleaning cycle, dump the litter for disposal, or initiate sterilization. The Setup screen includes selections for cleanup wait time (gives the cat time to get away), sleep mode, \u201csmart sterilization\u201d, indicator light (the button on front of the box), voice prompt (not sure yet how this works), and an option to return the system to factory settings., At the time of this writing I\u2019m quite happy with this machine. If anything important crops up, I\u2019ll amend this review. I docked it one star only because the app could be a lot better\u2014other than that, this is a very good automated litter box."

As a seasoned mechanical engineer, I have an innate passion for technology products. I spent a month researching various brands of automatic cat litter boxes until I stumbled upon Charmkits product on Amazon, and Ive been using it for a week now.\", Advantages:, Safety System, Charmkit employs a safety sensing gate design. After a cat uses the litter box, the machine attempts to close the gate after 20 seconds. When a cat approaches within a 50cm range in front of the machine, the sensor responds, halting the gate-closing command, and retrying after 15 seconds. To be frank, during the initial three days of using the product, Leon was repeatedly drawn to the sound of the gate closing, approaching it constantly, which resulted in cleaning sessions taking around 10 minutes. However, as of now, they have grown accustomed to the sound, and the machine operates swiftly., Sensor Quantity, \"Their design team wisely allocated resources where it matters most - product safety. The number of sensors it comes equipped with is the most extensive Ive seen so far. This includes a radar sensor in front of the machine with a range of 50cm, infrared sensors at the entrance, four gravity sensors at the bottom of the machine, two infrared sensors inside the waste compartment, and an internal motor anti-jamming cat detection current system. Compared to other brands that rely solely on radar sensors and gravity sensors, I personally believe Charmkits product offers more comprehensive cat proximity detection.\", Physical Deodorization, \"Clearly, the Charmkit team conducted in-depth research on other brands odor elimination methods and consulted professionals. They incorporated air purifier fresh air system technology to exchange air with the external environment to eliminate odors. Frankly, Im not a fan of chemical deodorizers or some brands aroma generators, and Im unsure if my cats would adapt to them. However, they have also provided a space for customers to place deodorizers if desired.\", Disadvantages:, Network Configuration Issues, \"I encountered an error when initially trying to connect to the 5GHz Wi-Fi network. Later, I turned off the 5GHz feature on my Wi-Fi router, connected to the 2.4GHz successfully, and then re-enabled 5GHz without any issues. This was a communication problem I discussed with the customer support team and was resolved satisfactorily. The complexity of each households network environment can be a factor.\", Unsuitable for Placement on Carpets, \"I initially placed the machine on a carpet and it detected Lilys weight as exceeding my expectations. After reviewing the manual again, I learned that it must be placed on a flat, non-carpeted surface for the gravity sensor to function effectively.\", Repetitive Information Push Notifications, Their camera utilizes motion detection, resulting in my receiving notifications on the app whenever my cat passes by the litter box. However, my cat Lily is quite active, so I would receive numerous notifications throughout the day, prompting me to disable this feature. The customer support team actively communicated with me and promised to optimize the types of notifications pushed."

Who hasn\\t accidentally hit the wrong button that pops you out of a game..I know I have. It has a decent tilt to it once the legs are extended and has a wrist rest built in (It\\s a hard plastic wrist rest but it does what its supposed to do).,   You can also increase/decrease/mute audio via the keyboard and theres an option to play/pause, stop and rewind/forward videos that you\\re watching. For those looking for programable keys (as far as I can tell) it doesn\\t have any. Its a more \"simple\" keyboard but unless you NEED those keys this works great for gaming. Overall its a great keyboard and it cost me aprx $45, worth the price imo. Pick it up and you won\\t be disappointed. Good luck and have fun gamer!!"

(2 different kybds now), 2) some combo key presses (ctrl+shift+m) are hit and miss. this was a defect with the kybd., \"i suspect they have an engineering problem with some m-boards. if i shutdown with the kybd turned off, it will not light again after a reboot. the work-around is persnickety and i will call support. btw, theyre quite responsive.\", 2nd UPDATE (3rd g213):, \"1) im becoming more convinced that the g213 has difficulty with the msi z490-pro m-board. all 3 exhibit the same no-illumination bios boot behavior after the initial use.\", 2) these kybds do have quality issues as all 3 had different behaviors with illumination. at least this last one seems to be recoverable. when the lights do not come on after a button press. the g-hub sw usually fixes the problem., 3) my 2nd kybd did have a combo key press defect with ctrl+shift+m keys and the need to be unplugged for several minutes before lighting. this one works much better but still no lights during the bios boot phase."

Im a pocket sized adult unfortunately that seemed to stop growing at 12, 112pds and 5ft. I was able to lift and carry the box in myself and after opening the box was able to lift the mower out with one hand (thankful for the handy little handle on the main portion of the mower.) I was a little disappointed to see this mower was mostly plastic bits. Once assembled (again, almost obscenely simple process) I used the convenient handle to lift and carry it back outside. After charging the battery and cranking this baby up, I was officially in love. I have bought several mowers, and every one of them were irritating to either carry, assemble or use. She may be small but she is mighty! I previously thought it was a brilliant idea to avoid irritating my neighbors with the noise and stupidly have been using a manual push mower, so my review may be colored by the difficulty of pushing through dense annoyingly healthy grass and weeds, but this mower is so quiet, I could hear my music on my headphones that I left around my neck. Even my husband on the video game inside didnt hear it. And the glory of gripping on to a mower that practically pushed itself was like an ice cold water being handed to you in a mosh pit as far from consessions as you can get. The height adjustment is great also. My 63 husband can push it as easily as I can, and so can my 10 year old (she is not happy about an added chore from time to time and that brings its own joy) Operation is dummy proof and it cuts through the heartiest of weeds like butter. The only downside is the grass catcher. I did need to empty it many times, but that was more due to my procrastination due to having unfortunate mowers until today. Now Im almost excited to see the grass grow annoyingly fast in monsoon season.\", All in all, this is an amazing mower for the price. It may not cut a wide path but that in itself is convenient for getting into the smaller spaces that seem unreasonably designed for a grassy swath of lawn. There is also a mulch plug which I also found convenient for my flower bed projects., \"I have a decent sized corner lot, and even with some heavy overgrowth in the back yard the battery lasted through 80% of my lot and recharged faster than my overused tablet charges. And my reservations on the plastic construction of it were unfounded. The materials are durable, even with my inherently clumsy nature, and the safety features are a big relief for that also. There is a safety key I can remove when I need to step away with my kids in the yard with me and start up is gentle so it doesnt scare the little humans so irritatingly playing in the middle of my planned route. So I have to give this a rare 5 star rating for being so perfectly made for small humans as well as large hulking beasts of a husband. And again, I must point out how quiet it is. Not a single eye roll from the neighbors with a new baby at 8 am!!! I did not have high hopes while assembling so I did not take any photos unfortunately. But if I can talk myself into avoiding mowing long enough to let the weeds have their 5 minutes of fame I will revise with some visuals. Highly recommended. (Though my daughter now disagrees)\""

This mower does a great job cutting the lawn. I have 3/4 of an acre to mow and like to keep it short (under 2 inches or less) depending on the season and rain. The mower is no heavier than a push gas mower. I have a steep hill in the front yard and am able to get my exercise for the day. :), Unfortunately, one of the welded reel blades is out of alignment and cannot be adjusted (only the long stationary blade is adjustable) so I am sending the mower back for a replacement. In the video, you can hear the noise the fifth blade makes when coming into contact with the stationary blade.

I never at any moment felt anything that said I injured myself but by that evening I had pain in the back of my knee and when I walked. After a week I found at times when standing it felt unstable and a clicking in my knee when I walked. I purchased this for support and it helps tremendously. Very solid support with multiple straps front and back to secure it., TIP: When putting this on have all 4 straps folded on themselves with their Velcro secured. The first step is wrapping the top and bottom of the main neoprene body and securing that Velcro. After that you have 2 Velcro straps at the top and bottom, front and back, 4 straps total to secure. When you remove it just fold the velcro of each of these straps together and it will make it much easier to put back on. Otherwise the Velcro of those 4 straps when exposed will stick to everything and make it difficult to put it on."

I went to my local Micro Center and tested every keyboard they had looking for one that felt nice, and the nice clicky ones tended to be very expensive and relatively noisy. This keyboard captures most of the feel of typing on those keyboards, but is quiet and much cheaper., \"The backlighting is blindingly bright, the color transitions on the flow mode are smooth and pretty, the lighting is even, and the colors are vibrant. I like that I can set it to plain white if I want. I always use it on the lower of the two keyboard brightness settings, and thats still too bright in a dim to medium lit room.\", \"The keys all work, they feel consistent and smooth, and its comfortable to type on. I do think a wrist rest might be needed though. I dont think the keycaps will wear over time, which is good because while theyre removable, they dont take standard keycaps and replacing them would likely be difficult.\", The keyboard frame is surprisingly dense and heavy. It is made out of a very sturdy plastic that feels solid, has no flex/creaking and sits evenly on my desk., \"Other pros: Number pad and dedicated media keys are great. The media keys dont feel as nice to press as the normal keys, and they arent backlit, but they do work well and arent too difficult to locate without looking.\", The cons:, \"-Media keys are not backlit. This really bugs me for some reason, I want all the keys to be backlit and it bothers me that some are and some arent.\", -The keyboard height is a little too tall and I think a wrist rest is probably needed for comfort for most people., \"-Numlock light is bright white and theres no way to leave numlock on and turn off the light. This is particular to my use, since I always leave Numlock on. Ill cover it with a sticker or something.\", \"-its got liquid drainage holes and would probably survive a spill, but my keys are particularly hard to get off and removing them and cleaning underneath would be probably take an hour or more.\", Overall, I do strongly recommend this keyboard. Other keyboards have per-key backlighting or Cherry MX keys or whatever but this one is good at the stuff a keyboard is supposed to do for the price. Most importantly, compared to the other similarly priced keyboards at Micro Center, these keys felt the nicest to type on- not wobbly or mushy."

I almost gave up at this point, but Im quite stubborn, and was determined to at least put it fully on once. And that is exactly what I did. As soon as I got the outer straps wrapped and fastened, I sat for a second, then immediately had to rip it off because it was causing so much pain and pressure on my kneecap that it was unbearable. For ACTUALLY GOOD patella support, I highly recommend the Exous Body Gear knee brace. It is comfortable, well made, and gives good solid support without being bulky (or causing additional pain!)

I\u2019ve been looking for something that would provide my front seats with some protection from small spills, food, dust, and dirt.  I saw these and thought I would try them., These covers fit my seats perfectly.  I have a 2023 Chevy Traverse and the head rests go up and down, but they don\u2019t come off.  These seat covers come in two sections, the car seat cover, and a separate headrest cover.  This allows you to easily adjust the headrest to whatever position you want.  A one-piece cover makes it difficult, if not impossible, to adjust your headrest. I ordered the black, gray, and mint green cover and I really like the pop of color that these covers provide to the inside of my SUV., I rated these a 4 because these covers offer no real protection from liquids (not even water resistant), so if you spill a drink on them, it will soak through (I tested them with water).  I will probably spray some Scotch Guard waterproofing, or another fabric protector, on these seat covers to add some extra protection."

I\u2019d rate the front seat covers a 5 all considered, but the rears just a 3 (and I got them for the fronts so Ill base my rating on that).\", What I like about these seat covers:, \u2022 Stitching is even; I didn\u2019t see any unevenness or blemishes during my install, \u2022 The material itself feels thick and sturdy. It is backed with foam., \u2022 Extra pocket on the front edge of the front seats. Perfect for a phone/wallet/parking access card, \u2022 Pockets in the back of the front seats. The Tacoma seats only come with a pocket behind the passenger seat, \u2022 They don\u2019t slide around. They fit well, have some inserts that go into the slot at the base of the seat/seat back, and have small rubber bumps on the backing. I didn\u2019t give the back seats as thorough of a test as the front., \u2022 Sturdy zippers at the top of the front seat covers, \u2022 Front headrest covers wrap around completely, \"\u2022 Sides are mostly open so you don\u2019t have to worry about impacting the side air bags. I dont trust an aftermarket item covering up that key safety device\", \u2022 The front seats seem to have a little more thickness on the sides where the bolsters are. Either this or the vinyl rather than OEM fabric gives me a more solid/cradled feeling in the seat. It feels sportier., \u2022 The color I got (black/grey) is similar to the pattern on the OEM fabric. The grey is a bit brighter and they add some openness to the cabin. It has a bolder sporty look also without being over the top., Some things to be aware of in case this matters to you:, \u2022 If you access the storage under/behind the rear seats frequently, the covers make it harder. Although there are 3 separate panels for the rear seat backs, the center panel velcros to the two side panels so you need to either fold both seats together or undo the velcro. Also since the factory seat bottoms fit together tightly, with the vinyl covers on it takes some extra tucking to make the covers fit flat where the bottoms meet., \u2022 Rear seat headrest covers just wrap over the headrests and don\u2019t include the sides. It covers the parts that can get dirty, but doesn\u2019t look as nice as the front headrests and are easy to bump off, \u2022 With the open sides on the front seats and the curved shape to the back, there is some looseness to the fabric. If you look you can see some of the foam backing. Most of the view of the open side and that backing is blocked by the pillar between the doors., \u2022 The pockets in the back of the front seat covers are 2 pockets; the Tacoma passenger seat had 1 longer pocket, Install notes:, \u2022 You could probably do the front seats quickly in 15 minutes or less. Installation took me about 90 minutes but I wanted it to all line up perfectly, and the back seats take a lot more effort as there are more pieces and they don\u2019t all wrap around, \u2022 The instructions are minimal but you can figure it out., \u2022 Look at the direction of the diagonals stitching on the seat covers; I put the rear seat back covers on upside down the first time. Probably no one would notice but I swapped them anyway, \u2022 The metal clips to go under the front seat don\u2019t have obvious connection points. On the driver\u2019s seat I connected them to the flattish metal bar holding the motors. On the passenger seat I wrapped them around the handle to adjust the seat and then connected them to each other. Maybe you\u2019ll find a better way., \u2022 The side straps on the rear seat backs looked different from the instructions. I fed the top/bottom strap through the single side strap"

Last mower had 1 single 60v battery and this is 2 40v. It\u2019s taking about 1 1/2 hours to charge each battery so about 3+ hours to fully charge everything. Mower cuts fine and I am able to get 1/2 my lawn cut at one time. Then charge batteries and cut the rest the next day. I like the 1 touch wheel height adjustment. The really odd part is the self propelled controls. You turn a dial located on a panel up near the handle area. Then you need to continually squeeze the handle while pushing mower forward. Other mowers I\u2019ve owned let this be the main propelled feature. This mower has an odd sliding hand grip that never locks into automatic. It\u2019s constantly sliding up and down while slipping in and out of gear. Between starting, turning the dial, keeping constant hand pressure on the stop control, and then having the handle sliding up and down takes a lot of eye/hand coordination. Lastly, unit came damaged in the carton. Not from shipping but manufacturers lack of inspection before packed. The pics show the scratches and gouging on the handle. Upon opening i found the handle is tucked pretty far down into the carton and wrapped in bubble wrap plastic and cardboard. I feel the shipper had to have seen this during packing and just let it go anyway. To sum up I don\u2019t use the self propelled function which was a main reason I paid more for this type feature. I\u2019ll probably upgrade soon and sell this one."

I\u2019d been holding on to my last pair for two years even though I\u2019d worn a hole in the fabric where my big toe sits lol. (I love this style THAT much.) I was so happy to see that this company was making the same style. We travel and go to a lot of concerts and festivals where we are standing for long periods of time or walking long distances. These are super comfortable for my feet. Am added bonus and one reason I\u2019ve had so many pairs of this style is that because they have a fabric in the foot area, you don\u2019t slide out of them when they are wet. Safety first, right?? lol Great for water parks, walks in the rain, tons of drinks spilled on your feet at rock shows\u2026you get the picture. It will be interesting to see how long the big toe portion holds up in this brand. That was my only negative and reason I had to keep restocking my Nike version. Will definitely buy again.

For longer grass it would have needed better traction from the wheels (like knobbly off road tires) to drive the gears. Longer grass also has a tendency to wrap the rotor spindles at the sides risking a jam. Small twigs in the grass can also jam the rotor. The basket clipped to the mower to catch the cuttings is mostly useless. I recommend not using it and instead just raking the lawn afterwards.

It is lightweight and easy to push through the grass despite no self-propelled feature. Now, the bad. The cutting depth adjustment could be better. The entire mower is made from plastic that easily warps and bends. The wheels do not stay in the same position and require checking several times during a mowing session. The rear right wheel was not positioned correctly, pinched the deck, and would not turn freely. I fixed this by pulling out the wheel and moving it back about 1/2 inch to free it. I would have returned it had I not needed to use it immediately. I am considering it a disposable lawnmower and will probably replace it soon. Dont buy.\""

This hose comes with a bonus 10-way spray nozzle and is designed for both commercial and residential use.\", Durability and Build Quality: The hose itself appears quite durable. The stainless steel construction with a fabric skin suggests a robust design capable of withstanding regular use in a variety of outdoor conditions., Ease of Use and Connections: One of the key features I appreciate is the ease of use, especially regarding the connections. They are straightforward to handle, attaching smoothly without binding or coming loose unintentionally. This ease of connection is crucial for frequent use in a garden or farm setting., \"Longevity: While I havent had the hose for a long time, its solid construction gives me confidence in its potential for long-term use. The quality of materials and build suggest it will be a lasting tool for my gardening and farming needs.\", \"Spray Nozzle Quality: The included 10-way spray nozzle, however, feels a bit cheap and does not seem to match the quality of the hose. It doesnt give the impression of being a durable component of the set.\", Overall, the PowerFlow Garden Hose seems like a solid product for various gardening and farming tasks. Its sturdy construction, combined with easy-to-use connections, make it a practical choice. While the quality of the included sprayer might be a slight letdown, the hose itself appears to be reliable and well-suited for both residential and commercial use."

The design and build are quality and will fit in with any kitchen setup.  It can be used with manual water fill or automatic.

With its auto standby mode, its not always running.\", **Update review, 8/20/2023**, \"I originally gave this icemaker a 5 star review.  It just worked great out of the box.  Ive only owned it for about 3 months now, used less than that. However, after about 2 months of use, it is now having problems.  I started using the the automatic water filler about a month ago which has been working until recently.  First the ice maker started making this occasional squeaking noise while making ice.  Its quite annoying.  Then the auto water filler stopped working.  Went through the manuals troubleshooting steps, nothing worked.  Tried to reach out to support for Upstreman, but their website is blank with just their name on it.\", \"There is a 12 month warranty on this product.

This luxury pro litter box has truly made life with multiple cats a breeze., \"One of the standout features is the ability to detect and recognize different cats. The Catlink App not only allows me to keep track of each cats toilet usage but also provides valuable insights into their health, including weight monitoring. Its like having a personal cat health assistant right in my pocket!\", The App control and data reports are a game-changer. I can access a 24-hour record, a 7-day/12-month health report, and even manage the litter box remotely. This has been incredibly convenient, especially for a multi-user household. The fact that multiple users can share a single litter box seamlessly is a testament to the thoughtful design of CATLINK., \"Safety was a top concern for me, and CATLINK has nailed it. The litter boxs radars, infrared sensors, and anti-pinch features ensure maximum safety. It immediately stops running if it detects a cat, providing peace of mind. The robust, vented design adds an extra layer of security, and the smart illumination is a thoughtful touch for elderly cats with poor eyesight.\", The various clean modes - Auto, Manual, Timer, and Empty - offer flexibility, and the option for both panel and remote app control is fantastic. The Do Not Disturb mode has been a lifesaver for creating a tranquil environment for my cats, and the panel lock prevents any accidental touches from curious pets or children., \"The size of the litter box is just perfect for my multiple cats, with a generous 57L globe capacity and a 13L waste drawer capacity. The warning about suitable cat weights and litter levels is a thoughtful touch, emphasizing CATLINKs commitment to the safety and well-being of our feline friends.\", The double odor removal system with a rechargeable odor purifier and carbon filter is a game-changer. It effectively eliminates unpleasant odors, formaldehyde, and ammonia, keeping my home smelling fresh and clean., \"The CATLINK Automatic Self Cleaning Cat Litter Box has simplified my life as a cat parent. Its not just a litter box; its a sophisticated, intelligent companion that prioritizes the health and well-being of my cats. If youre a cat owner, especially with multiple feline friends, investing in the CATLINK Luxury Pro is a decision you wont regret. Its truly a luxury for both you and your beloved cats!\""

Struggled on some patches, slowing, but charged through my small yard with ease in about 40 minutes.\", Ease of use: I think you can divulge that from all that I just explained., The only tip you need is get the power class you need for your lawn size and how much you tend to let it grow between mows. I bet that will shrink when you feel how easy this device is to use. Just make sure to charge your batteries after each use, storing them at full capacity and plug them in for a quick boost before use just in case some juice drained while it was stored., Enjoy & Have fun with your new yard toy. I sure did."

I compared them to similar seat covers, and none of them fully covered the headrests like these ones do., The material quality of the seat covers is excellent with a soft feeling. I feel great comfort during both short and long drives., The cleaning and maintenance are a breeze, finally freeing me from worries about kids getting my car dirty., Cons:, The installation does require time and patience, but thankfully they provided a step-by-step installation video that I found very well done and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching the installation video before attempting to install the seat covers as it greatly aids in a successful installation. Even with that, it still took me 2 hours., While the majority of the seat covers fit perfectly, the one for the power seat required minor adjustments, which took a bit of extra effort and patience., Do I love the seat covers? Of course I do, they look amazing. Despite the time-consuming installation process, the overall performance and value they offer make them a worthwhile investment, these are definitely the best seat covers outside of a $800+ dealership package.

We have two cats and I was looking for a new box I could rely on as much as that one.  All the reviews were terrible, with complaints about poor performance, arriving broken or not lasting very long, being more trouble than a manual box. People were talking about repairing their circuit boards, and taking out this microchip or motor, etc... I was surprised and overwhelmed when all of this came up as I searched for a new \"Litter Maid\". There were even hundreds of how-to YouTube videos discussing how to fix your \"Litter Maid\". This led me to realize I would need to do more research before buying a self-cleaning box and then I came across this one. I thought it would be a great option. I admit I was in a hurry and the price point made me think it may not be the best but I had two cats with nothing available to use.  I would try this in the meantime. I was stressed dealing with a flooded home, our family, our children, and the cats. I'm sure it was my mistake but somehow I thought it was like my Littermaid. It could be the proclaimed \"Self-Cleaning\" in the title. So please be aware this is NOT self-cleaning. It has no moving parts. It works on a sifting system. So you get the box, and you put the barrier grid in. After it is used sufficiently by your cats you roll it back and forth and the clumps go into the tray while the loose litter can sift through the grid to a different area. I found it only worked properly with the right clumping litter. If you get those little clumps or loose ones, you are right back to manual scooping, so why bother? This box can work under the right conditions, first I got mine for only $41 and change. It was the large multicat box, it was a covered box and there was little odor or tracking. I lined the waste tray with grocery bags for more hygienic, hands-free disposal. At that price, it doesn't cost much more than a regular pan litter box and I would rather roll and have the waste separated into a bag-lined bin than scoop. This however is not, in my opinion, a \"Self-Cleaning\" litter box. I didn't post pics as our box is not the cleanest at the moment but the seller's pics are perfectly accurate. I have no idea why anyone would purchase one of these for those I have seen priced $90 and greater. Like I said, NOT, self-cleaning."

It is lightweight and easy to push through the grass despite no self-propelled feature. Now, the bad. The cutting depth adjustment could be better. The entire mower is made from plastic that easily warps and bends. The wheels do not stay in the same position and require checking several times during a mowing session. The rear right wheel was not positioned correctly, pinched the deck, and would not turn freely. I fixed this by pulling out the wheel and moving it back about 1/2 inch to free it. I would have returned it had I not needed to use it immediately. I am considering it a disposable lawnmower and will probably replace it soon. Dont buy.\""

I like that the controls are on the front rather than top., It is pretty big, we tend to use it when it is very hot and the frig cannot keep up with demand, for parties or to make extra ice in anticipation for parties. I suspect buying the ice would be cheaper, but this works well. It will NOT make ice fast enough to keep up with a giant party, so be aware you will need to make some in advance., First of all, this does NOT keep the ice frozen once it is made. You need to babysit it and remove the ice it makes and put it in a freezer if you want to keep it. So it may make 26.5 lbs of ice in 24 hours, but you would need to be emptying it about every  hour and adding more water. The ice it makes is softer than frig ice, but harder than the other ice maker we have in the family. It is the kind people like to chew, but if you put it in a regular freezer it will harden up and last longer in drinks. If you like soft ice, this is great., Depending on the temperature of your house, it does make ice every 9 min or so. They are bullet shaped cubes with an indent in the middle., It blows out hot air. This is simple thermodynamics, if you want to cool the ice maker cold enough make ice it has to remove heat. So that side fan will be blowing out fairly hot air.  It is pretty quiet, but you can hear it., If you do not empty it the ice cubes will melt and drip back into the water reservoir to be recycled., You should this sit upright for 2 hours if you move it around much, like a refrigerator. This means if you do not use up all the water you need to either scoop it up, or after you dump it, make sure you wait 2 hours before starting it again., One of my family members has an ice machine like this in the  dorm, and they are big hit there, they let it run all the time which is a huge waste of electricity, but then they do always have ice., It does not have a handle for carrying. That would be a nice addition."

One of the least inexpensive ones I found and before I bought it had better reviews. I had to write one now after I\u2019ve had it for about 7 months. I\u2019ve had NO ISSUES. NONE. I have three cats and this is their only litter box until I purchase a second one for my closet. I say it\u2019s their only litter box because they will not go in their regular ones now only this ONE LITTER BOX! The app tells me they are going between 9-15 times a day\u2026 at this rate after this long I figured I\u2019d have issues and I havnt. I have seen online their customer service is great but I thankfully have not need them. It alarms when full which working 14-16 hour shifts 4 days in a row it\u2019s been life changing for both me and my cats. Even full, I never smelled the box. Two friends came over didn\u2019t even know I had animals. A little noisy but not as noisy as some I\u2019ve online and you can set it to not go off at night if you don\u2019t like it. The noise is not loud enough to wake me up at night either. Do not miss the label on do not push door when unboxing. I did and luckily stopped to look before damaging it. The ONLY, and I mean this, the ONLY issue I have with it is unhooking the claw for cleaning. Bring a pen or knife to help press the clamp down one at a time then pull together. I also have carpal tunnel so others may not have an issue with this. Cleaning is so simple once you get it down. Don\u2019t forget to place the litter box back inside BEFORE adding the litter when you clean it LOL. They send 2 claws which both have been working fantastic. For the price this one is amazing and I will be purchasing a second one. I will hopefully edit with a video."

My Doc recommended one with the side bars and hinges, but still many choices., I really like this one because:, It fits well, took me a few times of adjusting the first layer of velcro because the side bar on the inside of my knee pressed the knee cap. Solution: loosen the front velcro straps, tighten the back velcro straps., It stabilizes my knee: working in the kitchen, even just normal movements like emptying the dishwasher, your knee swivels a lot. This brace makes my knee feel much better doing normal daily activities., Fairly easy to get in and out of. I will say others recommended this on the outside of your pants, and it is more comfortable that way. However, during shorts weather, I am going to cut off the leg bottom of an old pair of knit leggings, and pull it up over my knee, attach the brace, then fold down the top (unfinished edge) of the legging, much like the knit layer they put on your leg before casting. That will add a layer of softness between my skin and the brace., \"Of course, mu light weight leggings were damp from sweat when I took it off yesterday (high 80s here) but my knee felt good.\", \"Im just trying to protect my knee until I can get a scope, and this is doing the job.\""

It is made from all organic powdered fruits and vegetables. Therefore it is more absorbent to your body than the synthetic ones. Although every ones experience will vary, here is my brief result of the product after taking 3 weeks (FYI. I am 48 years old male, non-smoker, non-drinker, and exercise regularly):\", 1. NO IMMEDIATE RESULT. Do not expect instant change in your health or even in your energy level. I did not experience any instant or immediate noticeable benefit. I also did not experience any negative effect. However, after three weeks, I begin to notice, my short term memory was better and I felt steady without going through ups and downs emotionally., 2. BIG PILL. The pill is on a larger side (7/8\" L x 3/8\" W x 3/8\" D). If you have a difficult time swallowing pills, then this will not be easy., 3. BIT PRICEY. About $20 for 30 count is expensive. Decent synthetic ones cost about $12 for 140 count., If you need to get organic B-Complex, then this Garden of Life is an excellent choice even if it is expensive. Recommended!"

What really sets this brand apart (other than being all-veggie and hypo-allergenic) is that each B vitamin is bonded correctly to its most natural form as found in food.

The B-12 isnt bound to cyanide-based compounds like in other supplements or energy drinks. Its all natural. Plus, for B-vitamins to be properly absorbed and utilized by the body, a compound called Foliate is needed, which is what is found in natural sources of food, containing B-vitamins. Folic Acid is a byproduct that is typically used in cheaper supplements.. again cause more issues and less absorption.\", \"In short, if you truly need B-vitamins in your daily life (most people do) with all of the benefits they bring, you cant skimp to buy cheap supplements.

The included litter mat catches most of the litter, significantly reducing scatter at the entrance and keeping my home much cleaner., 4.  The cleaning sound is remarkably low, almost inaudible.

I can hardly detect any odd smells., \"6.  It features a weight measurement function and can identify which cat is using the toilet. However, during setup, its crucial to set the weight correctly to avoid misidentifying different cats.\", 7.  Its safety performance is top-notch. The machine stops as soon as a cat approaches, and sensors detect when the cat leaves the litter box, triggering automatic operation., \"Overall, its outstanding.

The size is nice to move your mouse around--I play at 60-70cm/360 so having more mouse space is a must for me. The one I ordered has red switches which are more favoured for gaming compared to blues or browns. I must say that this is my first 60 percent keyboard and I dont mind missing the arrow keys, Numpad, or function keys. I can use the FN key at the bottom right and press keys with a second function. In my experience, it wasnt annoying and dont miss dedicated keys for home, del, PgUp, etc. In fact, those keys are closer now. I can hold FN with my right pinkie and use my other hand or fingers to hit the other keys just fine. For example, I hold FN with my right pinkie and use my index, middle and ring finger to use the arrow keys. Furthermore, The switches themselves have a fence around the cherry MX stem so wobble is reduced somewhat.\", \"However, I have several gripes with this keyboard. The first is the sound, there seems to be some faint rattles and pings if you listen closely but it shouldnt be a problem if you dont pay attention to it. The bigger keys have bad stabilizers as they feel restricted and not as linear compared to the smaller keys with no stabilizers. In other words, the smaller keys feel smooth but the bigger ones feel rough; the spacebar is an exception though. The keycaps feel like they are made out of ABS plastic and arent PBT, but they have texture to them so it will take longer to oil out--it looks different from the fabricated product images. Moreover, the cable is bit short as I needed to use my longer usb-c cable from my TKL and use it. The cable it comes with is not braided and only one colour (blue) is available for lighting.\", \"Despite all the gripes, I am happy with the keyboard especially because of how much I paid for it. It is cheap and I dont mind eating while gaming with it or smashing it in a fit of rage (btw it has little flex). I could easily buy another one if it breaks. Id say its worth the price and I recommend it if you dont use it to type but to game.\""
