My experience with bags/cases is as a golfer.  Ive been playing golf for a long time, so I have years of experience evaluating and buying golf bags.  Im also a guitar player and have many guitar gig bags.  I see numerous similarities in what you would want between a golf bag, gig bags, and a pool cue bag/case:"", 1.  Quality, 2.  Organization, 3.  Style, 4. Comfort, 5. Value, Upon removing this from the Amazon shipping box, I was totally impressed with the pool cue bag.  it looks great.  The zippers are high quality and the piping is stylish., FRONT OUTSIDE FEATURES:, On the front, there are two zippered pockets.  In the larger pocket, there are two pockets and elastic straps on the bag side that I assume might work for a jump cue.  On the lid side, there are two zippered mesh pockets you can use for various accessories.  In the smaller pocket, there is another mesh pocket and another solid zippered pocket., MAIN COMPARTMENT FEATURES:, Inside the main compartment, there are 8 very soft, padded sleeves and elastic strips for four cue shafts & butts.  There is a padded divider that protects the cue components from banging together when the main compartment is closed., BACK OF CASE AND CARRY STRAPS:, ""Im a guitar player and this is where this case reminds me of high-end guitar gig bags that cost hundreds of dollars.  There are FOUR ways to carry this bag:"", -Side carrying handle straps with a Velcro handle, -Carrying strap on the end, -Single shoulder strap, AND DRUM ROLL, PLEASE..., ""-Dual padded backpack straps that include a zippered compartment to hide the strap away when you dont want to carry it like a backpack.  I have expensive Mono and Reunion Blues guitar gig bags that have this feature, so I was very impressed to see that GOBUROS thought to include this in their feature set."", SUMMARY:, Yes, I was fortunate to get this via Amazon Vine, and yes it might be cool to have a prestigious case from Predator, Cuetec, etc., but I would buy this case.  There are quite a few cue bags/cases in this price range, but I would definitely consider this GOBUROS., PROS:, ""-Quality - Im really, really impressed with the quality and design of this bag."", -Cost-effective.  You can spend a lot of money on high-end, brand-name cue cases, but why?, -All or most of the features you might want., -Stylish - looks great, -Please of room for 4 cues and a lot of accessories, -Protective - This should keep your cues safe (unless the TSA gets their hands on it.  LOL), CONS:, -None really, -It does not have full-length sleeves like a Cuetec, ""-It might be more than you need if youre only going to transport one or two cues, but why not have enough space so you wont need to buy a bigger bag later?"", EDIT:, ""After I posted the review, I went to the GOBUROS store and realized why this bag is so good.  GOBUROS makes all kinds of bags/cases for various purposes, such as RC cars, baseball, golf, tactical gun range bags, etc.  Many of those have to carry much more weight than a pool cue bag/case.  It seems their expertise comes from first being a manufacturer of bags and then making a bag for pool/billiards purposes.  This bag is almost a little over-engineered based on the amount of weight it has to carry.  I really believe this bag will last for years, so its just a matter of determining if YOU like the features.""","{'feature': 'weight distribution of billiard-cue-sticks', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Inside the main compartment, there are 8 very soft, padded sleeves and elastic strips for four cue shafts & butts.

My experience with bags/cases is as a golfer.  Ive been playing golf for a long time, so I have years of experience evaluating and buying golf bags.  Im also a guitar player and have many guitar gig bags.  I see numerous similarities in what you would want between a golf bag, gig bags, and a pool cue bag/case:"", 1.  Quality, 2.  Organization, 3.  Style, 4. Comfort, 5. Value, Upon removing this from the Amazon shipping box, I was totally impressed with the pool cue bag.  it looks great.  The zippers are high quality and the piping is stylish., FRONT OUTSIDE FEATURES:, On the front, there are two zippered pockets.  In the larger pocket, there are two pockets and elastic straps on the bag side that I assume might work for a jump cue.  On the lid side, there are two zippered mesh pockets you can use for various accessories.  In the smaller pocket, there is another mesh pocket and another solid zippered pocket., MAIN COMPARTMENT FEATURES:, Inside the main compartment, there are 8 very soft, padded sleeves and elastic strips for four cue shafts & butts.  There is a padded divider that protects the cue components from banging together when the main compartment is closed., BACK OF CASE AND CARRY STRAPS:, ""Im a guitar player and this is where this case reminds me of high-end guitar gig bags that cost hundreds of dollars.  There are FOUR ways to carry this bag:"", -Side carrying handle straps with a Velcro handle, -Carrying strap on the end, -Single shoulder strap, AND DRUM ROLL, PLEASE..., ""-Dual padded backpack straps that include a zippered compartment to hide the strap away when you dont want to carry it like a backpack.  I have expensive Mono and Reunion Blues guitar gig bags that have this feature, so I was very impressed to see that GOBUROS thought to include this in their feature set."", SUMMARY:, Yes, I was fortunate to get this via Amazon Vine, and yes it might be cool to have a prestigious case from Predator, Cuetec, etc., but I would buy this case.  There are quite a few cue bags/cases in this price range, but I would definitely consider this GOBUROS., PROS:, ""-Quality - Im really, really impressed with the quality and design of this bag."", -Cost-effective.  You can spend a lot of money on high-end, brand-name cue cases, but why?, -All or most of the features you might want., -Stylish - looks great, -Please of room for 4 cues and a lot of accessories, -Protective - This should keep your cues safe (unless the TSA gets their hands on it.  LOL), CONS:, -None really, -It does not have full-length sleeves like a Cuetec, ""-It might be more than you need if youre only going to transport one or two cues, but why not have enough space so you wont need to buy a bigger bag later?"", EDIT:, ""After I posted the review, I went to the GOBUROS store and realized why this bag is so good.  GOBUROS makes all kinds of bags/cases for various purposes, such as RC cars, baseball, golf, tactical gun range bags, etc.  Many of those have to carry much more weight than a pool cue bag/case.  It seems their expertise comes from first being a manufacturer of bags and then making a bag for pool/billiards purposes.  This bag is almost a little over-engineered based on the amount of weight it has to carry.
