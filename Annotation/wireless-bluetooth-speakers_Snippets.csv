The JBL lacked range, lacked balance, it’s just not musical.

The only thing going for it In the listening category is efficiency—more dBs for the same volume setting.

Bravo! I still find the app to be clunky, but workable., Original review:, I purchased 3 of these speakers over time, because they claim to be able to be used in stereo as well as “Party Mode”. Party mode allows for multiple speakers (more than 2)  to be connected to play music (non-stereo)., I installed the JBL Portable app to my iphone after purchasing my first speaker. It seemed to have no functionality at all. Not even an option to configure stereo or party mode., After purchasing a second speaker, (for stereo), the first annoyance is the included ridiculous universal picto-style instructions, that don’t really tell you how to connect the speakers together in party mode. There is no info on stereo connection provided at all. I then went to the JBL web site. The downloadable instructions are the same worthless info included in the box. I did a web search for instructions. JBL does provide instructions on how to connect 2 speakers for stereo, using the JBL Portable App., I downloaded the JBL Portable app again. This time it allowed me to change the Bluetooth name for the speakers. This updated app also looked like it actually had a purpose, but I was wrong. It does nothing else useful. It will not simultaneously connect to two speakers. It just toggles back and forth between the two speakers, endlessly asking me to connect a speaker. It never gives any option for stereo or party mode. Trash-Ware!, The instructions provided by JBL on their website for stereo connection do not work and the app does not function properly., I recently purchased a third speaker for use in a larger meeting room. Again, the app was useless beyond allowing me to rename the speakers., I scrapped the app and spent 30 minutes trying to manually get 3 speakers connected for “Party Mode”. I finally figured out the proper sequence of turning things on and pressing buttons to get 3 speakers playing together. Two speaker, true “Stereo Mode”, just doesn’t work., I finally tried removing and re-installing the app. Same garbage app. So I’m stuck with playing mono on 1-3 speakers., Adding insult to injury, the JBL speaker models are not cross compatible for stereo. So Flip 5 speakers will not work with Flip 4 or Flip 6 speakers in stereo mode. So if one of your JBL speakers goes bad, and that model is no longer available, you cannot purchase a newer or older model to get going in stereo again., The engineers did a great job on the hardware.

The linking process is cumbersome and requires multiple attempts to connect the speakers properly, which can be very frustrating., Additionally, Bose chose to only support smartphones for stereo, so these speakers cannot be used to stream stereo from something like a MacBook - my primary want!

It does not consistently connect two speakers for stereo playback, which is frustrating and adds to the overall poor connectivity experience., In comparison, Sonos and Apple products offer a seamless and intuitive connectivity experience, which is what consumers expect and - honestly - deserve. The excellent sound quality of the Bose Soundlink speakers is significantly overshadowed by the frustrating software connectivity experience. Overall, while the sound quality is impressive, the connectivity experience might turn out to be a refundable violation for you., ""Bottom line: If you want to stream stereo from your mobile computer, YOU CANNOT USE a pair of these speakers - they will not work with Bose offering customers support for notebook computers, full stop.

I will break down the reasoning for my rating below., Once I noticed that two of these speakers could be paired together and synced up (along with the average reviews) I decided to purchase them.,   Powering on, initially connecting them via Bluetooth and syncing up multiple speakers are all quite simple, and the speakers themselves are easy to use. The speakers are surprisingly light, as well., The sound quality on these speakers is quite impressive (for their size), and when placed in ideal locations from each other they can mimic surround sound to a nice degree., The battery life seems to be quite extensive, but I typically just keep mine plugged in while they are powered on., My major gripe with these speakers is the simple fact that, even when my phone is set to vibrate, they will still prioritize the call and ring over the music currently playing (at what sounds like the maximum volume), even when I have the volume set to be lower on my paired phone. It’s oddly inconsistent, because it doesn’t seem to do this when receiving text messages., I’ve received calls (on vibrate mode) when using other Bluetooth speakers and this never happens., It’s quite frustrating when entertaining anyone with music and have to keep my phone on Airplane Mode to avoid such things from happening., Perhaps I’m overlooking something in the settings that can correct this, but as far as I can tell, it’s apparent that it’s “just how it is”., In summation, if you’re in the unique situation where you’re looking for multiple synced portable speakers with great sound (and decent balance of bass) at a lower price, then pick a couple of these bad boys up. Just be prepared to get interrupted by a phone call if you’re not in airplane mode (even on vibrate mode)., I hope this review helps., Thanks for taking the time to read it!","{'feature': 'portability of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The speakers are surprisingly light, as well', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the speakers are surprisingly light, which makes them portable.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",portability,"The user mentioned that the speakers are surprisingly light, which makes them portable.",,"The speakers are surprisingly light, making them portable.",yes

The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange. I use this as a bedroom speaker for relaxation and sleeping sound tracks like ocean and forest sounds. The volume is great and has plenty of range and power for the room. The sound quality doesn\t suffer at higher volumes. I listen to ambient sounds as I mentioned above as well as acoustic guitar and blue grass. I\ve been pleased with the sound quality for that type of music. I\ve used the speaker outside on my deck at a picnic table and it had plenty of power to fill the area. Many people describe sound quality from these type of speakers as ""tinny"" or weak, however this speaker is not like that. A great feature of the speaker is the hands free calling feature. This works seamlessly when the speaker is paired with my phone (iPhone 6+) and I\m pleased with the call sound and the microphone. The company claims this speaker is redesigned to be more powerful and have deeper bass. I agree with that claim, however my expectations are aligned with a speaker of this type and size. You should not be expecting sound like you would get from larger stereo speakers. My recommendation for the BEST performance and sound quality is to also download a high quality Equalizer App for your iPhone and use it when playing your music. The app I use is called ""Equalizer"" from Audioforge. My previous Oontz was difficult to pair, but pairing this speaker is quick and easy. The annoying blue light that was located on the front of the older Oontz has been relocated to the side panel of this speaker. My experience with battery life is about 7 -12 hours between charges. However, I would like a longer charging cord. The included USB cord is quite short (6 inches) and has to located directly near the power source. The speaker does not come with a wall charger. A 3.5 mm, 32 inch audio cable is included.  This speaker is designed to be water proof and as such the controls are on the sealed, silicone end panel and have raised ridges to help you locate them. The charging port and 3.5 mm jack port are located on the back panel of the speaker under a tight, silicone flap that\s just a bit tricky to open. The sealed power button is directly above the ports. The front panel is a typical metal, perforated grill. The bass radiators are on the bottom panel along with nonskid silicone feet. Overall, I enjoy this speaker, I am pleased with its performance, the sale price was low compared to the quality and features and Cambridge is a known, established, American company. I\ve contacted Cambridge customer service and received prompt and expert service. The Cambridge website has plenty of resources and information as well. If you need a quality, portable speaker with great performance, give this one a try.","{'feature': 'sound quality of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the sound quality is better than his previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",sound quality,The user mentioned that the sound quality is better than his previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange.,,The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange.,yes

You are supposed to be able to put it anywhere and have good sound, but like most BT speakers, if you place it near a wall, the bass really comes alive and it sounds impressive for its size.

Not an issue for me but I know a lot of people use those to plug in older devices. The USB connection has been upgraded from Micro USB to USB-C and the port is protected by a rubber cover. The strap is improved and is a lot easier to disconnect to connect it to something. The strap is also thicker and removable if you dont want it. One of the bigger changes is the removal of the soft rubberized coating the XB12 has. This new model has a hard plastic coating, and it probably lasts longer and seems more durable than the previous style although its not as soft to the touch."", ""The controls are basic but they do everything you need. Power button, Bluetooth pairing, which doubles as a way to add a second speaker for a stereo pair, Play/pause button which activates your Siri or other voice command if you hold it down and a double press will advance to the next track. 3 presses rewinds. The other 2 buttons are volume up and down and thats it. Simple but effective. Pairing is very simple and takes just a few seconds. You just do it once and after that it takes about 2 seconds after turning the power on until the device connects to it. Everything works so smoothly, and the product has a high quality feel when using it."", ""Battery life is very good, up to 16 hours and there is a low battery indicator built in.

I would love to use the custom EQ to adjust the bass.  With the bass boost, it is too much bass and the sound is a little bit muddled to me, but a little tinny without it.  This is being picky, though.  We do enjoy listening to this., This does have two drivers and two passive bass radiators, so you get more of a stereo sound than speakers that just have one of each., SPOKEN WORD:, Unlike some other speakers that I have tried, this works great for spoken word such as audiobooks.  The words are nice and clear.  There is not popping, cutting out, etc. that I have had with a couple of Bluetooth speakers., LIGHTS:, There are different light effects that you can get by pushing the “light” button (it looks like a sun)., EQUALIZER:, This is listed as a feature and there is a button for it.  I cannot figure out how to use this.  The instructions are very sparse.  They show that you are supposed to have your Bluetooth on and push the EQ button, with a photo of settings on your phone.  (I added a photo of the instructions).  I did not find any apps on the app store for Yier or Boomhero.  I cannot find a website either for more information.  Pressing the EQ button then the up/down buttons does not work either.,  I tried using the Apple EQ settings, but they did not seem to make any difference (& those are just choosing different types of music, not true customizable equalizer settings)., *** If anyone else reviewing this figures it out, would you please post instructions on your review., VOLUME/ WATTAGE:, It is stated to have 80 watts, but sounds about like my 40-watt speakers.  After looking at the webpage again, it states 50 watts with 80 watts peak.  I am not sure what that means (maybe at full volume with a louder song and lots of bass?), POWER/ PORTS:, It charges with a USB-C port and charging cord.  There is also a USB-A port to charge devices using this as a portable battery.  It also has an Aux port., The instructions state that you should charge it fully every three months to “protect the battery lifespan”, but there is no indication on the speaker of how much charge that it has., TWS:, They state that you can pair two of these speakers for True Wireless Stereo., If you are looking for a rugged Bluetooth speaker that you can carry around outside, this may be the one for you.

For a tiny little speaker, it actually packs a punch when it comes to bass.  Generally the speaker is booming and quite surprisingly boomy for the tiny little form factor. But when it comes to mids and highs it is not crisp It is sloppy and the timing is just not there.  Overall sound quality is muddy. But if youre out camping and not really thinking about high-end audio I think most people will be happy."", ""I have almost a dozen other portable speakers that perhaps isnt built as well as this speaker but I can share that these speakers sound significantly better than this Bose speaker. Not to mention that those off-brand speakers also cost 60-100$ tops."", Take a quick listen to the video and you will understand what I mean by a boomy speaker that sounds somewhat sloppy., Bluetooth connectivity is quick and reliable. You can even put perhaps an old google chrome audio (discontinued) to the line IN and get some wifi casted music through this thing ., ""The charging is via a micro USB port.  Its a shame that in 2021 it is not a USB-C port."", At the back of the unit there is a 3.5 mini plug auxiliary input., In terms of weatherproofing generally I find that it fares well in light rain however there is no weather seal plugs on any of the input ports like charging or auxiliary in.  Too bad., So in summary:, ""If you are looking for a portable speaker that sounds decent then I dont think that this speaker barrel cuts it.  If you are looking for a speaker that is built like a tank and withstands some outdoor use then I think this might be the ticket."", I hope this helps!, update:, BTW I forgot to mention, this unit has exposed pads to accept a Bose SoundLink Revolve Charging Cradle accessory. It is a 40$ accessory that docks the Bose unit to keep it charged and ready to go.  You dont need this because you can just charge it with the usb cable.  More of a convenient sake accessory., I also used the product  from start to finish of battery and it lasted approx 12 hours for me at moderate ""background"" levels of volumes outside on the porch.  not bad at all.","{'feature': 'sound quality of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'In general it isnt horrible but it is an exceptional either.

I was able to hear those cymbals and screaming guitar solo in rock music like you should in person.  I can hear the high registers on violins and flutes in classical music like you should.  I’m sure audiophiles will scoff at me, but I like to hear music the way I like to hear it.  This speaker let me do just that.  The “BassUp” feature in my opinion is just kind of a gimmick.  From what I can tell, all it does is pull down the highs.  Again, this speaker has a equalizer on the app to adjust everything the way you want anyway.  Placing the speaker in a corner or right in front of a wall gives more felt bass in my experience.  The battery makes it at high volume for an entire evening’s campfire, so that works for me.  I’m sure it would make an 8-10 hour day at a reasonable volume.  The exterior felt more high end on the Bose, but this speaker is not bad at all.  Both feel much more luxurious than our old Doss.  It is noticeably heavier than our old speaker and the Bose if that matters to you.  That being said, none of them feel like you are carrying a lead bar.  The sound that comes from all speakers this size and weight absolutely amazes me!  The slim shape makes it really easy to slip in a big pocket or bag or just carry.  The build feels very solid all around.  I haven’t dropped it yet, but if it’s anything like our old speaker, I am sure it would survive all but the worst falls.  I’ve had no problem with Bluetooth connectivity, and it is quick to connect.  At this point, I have no real complaints in sound or functionality.

Bose dont even give an EQ; Sony give you a three band EQ; LG give you a poor 5 band; JBL gives you a simple dual-band; you get the idea."", ""One person in particular, by the name of Oluvs Gadgets gave the speaker a review and made his own custom EQ for the speaker, which happened to impress him so much he have it a rare gold award, on par (at the very least) with Earfuls UBoom L, which has long held the title of best bluetooth speaker for him specifically."", Importing his EQ was a breeze, and using his preset felt as if I was using a different speaker altogether, and it was for the better, no doubt about that., ""The sound is accurate and neutral, whilst still delivering on those all important bass notes in more bass prevalent tracks. Low bass is unaffected, and limiting on a speaker of this size. The Harman Pardon Luna is for the bass fans, but strong deep bass doesnt make for an accurate speaker. As with most bluetooth speakers, its reliant on mid-bass, and with Oluvs EQ, it sounds great."", ""At the default signature  preset, side by side with my Bose Soundlink Flex, the Bose is too boomy, with its bass overwhelming everything else, but the Motion 300 isnt all that much better; it just sounds muddy and less powerful. Switching to the imported EQ present, its a whole different ball game; it completely leaves the Flex in the dust.

Well in one sense yes, because its managed to outshine every other portable speaker I own, with a custom EQ preset. In another sense, perhaps more importantly, no. As seems to be the case with the Q30 headphones, from which every subsequent model sounded poor, Anker appear to rely on sheer luck when it comes to good sound tuning, i.e., its just a case of luck if their next headphone/speaker sounds good or not.

I can recover some quality by using the EQ built into the Spotify app, it's just a pain and you lose some loudness/volume when you boost the bass/treble.

As the title says, it’s a really fine speaker system. I do have some quibbles with it, but I have used many other Bluetooth speaker systems and in terms of the X8 versus them, It’s the best one I’ve tried. The volume is quite good, the stereo separation is surprisingly good for a single unit. I have not tried pairing it with a second unit., What makes the X8 stand out for me is the EQ button, which almost no other Bluetooth speaker has. Many of them claim to have deep bass, but being an audio engineer, I know but not all music sources are the same. For instance watching television is a relatively mid range sound source. Listening to YouTube videos is a very different animal.  And gaming and watching movies is a third. The default setting when you turn it on is appropriate for watching television and many audio sources. It’s the most balanced sound with good bass and and smooth even mid range. It works for classical music sources, and jazz, as well as oldies Pop music.  If you switch to the second setting, You get enhanced mid range, so that works for spoken word meaning podcasts, and any spoken audio. Even some music sources benefit from the enhanced mid range., The third setting has very strong base, better than I’ve heard in any other speaker that I’ve tried. There are two passive subwoofer ports on either end, which are completely waterproof, So bring it to the pool, submerge it in the pool, use it at the beach etc. and you have nothing to worry about & as I say, the sound pressure for deep bass is crisp and handles hip-hop music, rock music and any source that has strong base. The base is crystal clear, which I have not found in any other unit, they usually have a muffled bass sound which is pretty awful.,  Obviously any sound source you’re using, may benefit from any one of the three settings, and that’s what sets this apart from any other unit. That is also why most of the units fail to deliver. Every sound source is different and the X8 gives you the opportunity to adjust to any type of sound quality. I had originally purchased the X10 from the same company which is smaller and roughly half the wattage, and even though it has the passive drivers, it just isn’t loud enough or powerful enough, so I returned it to get this 40 want unit. Also the two speakers are side by side in the round cylinder so you actually get a very true stereo quality. All the other units I’ve tried don’t actually sound like their stereo, they probably work with the pairing of another unit, but these are all called stereo, and I want the single unit to sound like a stereo., I should note that the buttons, while they feel positively military grade and I assume will last practically forever, they are hard to press, so if you have imited strength in your hands you may find it difficult to press any of the buttons, they are quite stiff. However I have read reviews of brother units that all say the buttons fail after a short period of time so I’m willing to deal with a bit of extra effort to work the buttons on the X8. Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and it works great. As to the battery life, all these companies just lie. There isn’t anyway on this planet that this unit gives you 30 hours of audio. It lasts for a good session of a couple of hours, an afternoon at the pool but it will need recharging after that. No I have a unit at this price point with this much power, will last any longer than the 2600 Milla amp battery X8 has. 40 wants requires a significant amount of power, and that’s that . You can’t change the laws of physics, and they’d have to put a huge battery in it for it to actually last 30 hours. I can’t review the telephone functionality , because I don’t use it and I wouldn’t. Because the X8 has so many different functions, many of the functions use the same buttons as the basic volume, EQ, & on off functions,  but there are double presses, long hold presses, and to me that’s just confusing, but there’s just a limited number of buttons so each one has multiple jobs., Strangely, The manual that I got with this unit which was brand new and sealed and obviously not repackaged, has instructions are completely wrong. They are in fact the instructions that work for the X10, Because I had the X 10 and I know how the buttons work on that.There are buttons labeled nine 1011 and 12, that don’t exist on this. Having had the X10, I know that the instructions actually match the X10 not this X8. That said, with a bit of playing around I figured out the correct buttons to use. you may be able to contact the company, and get a set of the correct instructions.  The basic functions work perfectly fine : Power on power off, EQ button, volume up volume down, etc. These units, coming from China always seem to have a problem with the instructions. but the bottom line is you want good sound and you want the ability to adjust the EQ for different ways you want to use the speaker, that’s why I’m keeping this, and I really like it, because it does what a 40 watt speaker is supposed to do., All in one I’m giving it four stars because it’s an extremely well built unit and feels very solid, has very good volume, superior  bass and the ability to adjust the sound, which as I say, is way better than any other at this price point. I consider it an excellent value for the money. I highly recommend it.","{'feature': 'connectivity range of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and it works great', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and it works great', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",connectivity range,The user mentioned that the Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and it works great,,Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and works great.,yes

As the title says, it’s a really fine speaker system. I do have some quibbles with it, but I have used many other Bluetooth speaker systems and in terms of the X8 versus them, It’s the best one I’ve tried. The volume is quite good, the stereo separation is surprisingly good for a single unit. I have not tried pairing it with a second unit., What makes the X8 stand out for me is the EQ button, which almost no other Bluetooth speaker has. Many of them claim to have deep bass, but being an audio engineer, I know but not all music sources are the same. For instance watching television is a relatively mid range sound source. Listening to YouTube videos is a very different animal.  And gaming and watching movies is a third. The default setting when you turn it on is appropriate for watching television and many audio sources. It’s the most balanced sound with good bass and and smooth even mid range. It works for classical music sources, and jazz, as well as oldies Pop music.  If you switch to the second setting, You get enhanced mid range, so that works for spoken word meaning podcasts, and any spoken audio. Even some music sources benefit from the enhanced mid range., The third setting has very strong base, better than I’ve heard in any other speaker that I’ve tried. There are two passive subwoofer ports on either end, which are completely waterproof, So bring it to the pool, submerge it in the pool, use it at the beach etc. and you have nothing to worry about & as I say, the sound pressure for deep bass is crisp and handles hip-hop music, rock music and any source that has strong base. The base is crystal clear, which I have not found in any other unit, they usually have a muffled bass sound which is pretty awful.,  Obviously any sound source you’re using, may benefit from any one of the three settings, and that’s what sets this apart from any other unit. That is also why most of the units fail to deliver. Every sound source is different and the X8 gives you the opportunity to adjust to any type of sound quality. I had originally purchased the X10 from the same company which is smaller and roughly half the wattage, and even though it has the passive drivers, it just isn’t loud enough or powerful enough, so I returned it to get this 40 want unit. Also the two speakers are side by side in the round cylinder so you actually get a very true stereo quality. All the other units I’ve tried don’t actually sound like their stereo, they probably work with the pairing of another unit, but these are all called stereo, and I want the single unit to sound like a stereo., I should note that the buttons, while they feel positively military grade and I assume will last practically forever, they are hard to press, so if you have imited strength in your hands you may find it difficult to press any of the buttons, they are quite stiff. However I have read reviews of brother units that all say the buttons fail after a short period of time so I’m willing to deal with a bit of extra effort to work the buttons on the X8. Bluetooth pairing is extremely easy and it works great. As to the battery life, all these companies just lie. There isn’t anyway on this planet that this unit gives you 30 hours of audio. It lasts for a good session of a couple of hours, an afternoon at the pool but it will need recharging after that. No I have a unit at this price point with this much power, will last any longer than the 2600 Milla amp battery X8 has. 40 wants requires a significant amount of power, and that’s that . You can’t change the laws of physics, and they’d have to put a huge battery in it for it to actually last 30 hours. I can’t review the telephone functionality , because I don’t use it and I wouldn’t. Because the X8 has so many different functions, many of the functions use the same buttons as the basic volume, EQ, & on off functions,  but there are double presses, long hold presses, and to me that’s just confusing, but there’s just a limited number of buttons so each one has multiple jobs., Strangely, The manual that I got with this unit which was brand new and sealed and obviously not repackaged, has instructions are completely wrong. They are in fact the instructions that work for the X10, Because I had the X 10 and I know how the buttons work on that.There are buttons labeled nine 1011 and 12, that don’t exist on this. Having had the X10, I know that the instructions actually match the X10 not this X8. That said, with a bit of playing around I figured out the correct buttons to use. you may be able to contact the company, and get a set of the correct instructions.  The basic functions work perfectly fine : Power on power off, EQ button, volume up volume down, etc. These units, coming from China always seem to have a problem with the instructions. but the bottom line is you want good sound and you want the ability to adjust the EQ for different ways you want to use the speaker, that’s why I’m keeping this, and I really like it, because it does what a 40 watt speaker is supposed to do., All in one I’m giving it four stars because it’s an extremely well built unit and feels very solid, has very good volume, superior  bass and the ability to adjust the sound, which as I say, is way better than any other at this price point. I consider it an excellent value for the money.

Both of the other EQ modes sound ok too, although the Base boost mode did start to sound distorted at higher volume levels. The base hits in that mode do hit harder and deeper, but they also sound restrained, and it sounds like maybe theres a point at which a crossover prevents damage to the speaker by holding back on me. The overall volume level doesnt really seem to get very loud, either. Just lots enough for a fairly big room, and Im sure it will suffice for sitting around a campfire."", ""The perfectly round shape might become pretty annoying when I just want to lay the speaker on its side. I wish they had built in a couple of hinged flaps that could be swung out for the purpose of preventing it from just rolling right off of a flat surface like a table. Just little solid tabs that could pop out and stay extended in place by magnetic force or something, and then be retracted back flush into the side of the speaker when not needed. Although at least theres a nice, thick rubber strap on a swivel at the top for carrying or hanging, and it seems like it might be just enough to prevent the speaker from rolling away as long as you position the strap in just the right way when you lay the speaker on its side."", Of course you can always just stand the speaker up vertically, but with a bass radiator on each end the one on the bottom might cause undue rattling of any stuff on that table, especially at higher volumes., I need to see how long it will last during my upcoming camping trip, and I think 10 hours of battery life at a volume around halfway to three-quarters would be ok for me. 30 hours seems like something you could maybe get at a really low volume and with the cool lights turned off.  I think it takes maybe 5 hours to fully charge, and that's fine for me. That means the internal batteries don't get really hot by cramming a bunch of energy into them really fast. So you'll likely get years of reliable use before the batteries ever start to crap out on you. Beware of any Bluetooth speaker that claims to have ""sick, lit, extreme fast charging* or whatever, because it's internal batteries probably will start letting you down within a year if you use it frequently., ""And this thing is built like a tank. If I accidentally drop it off a rocky cliff, theres a fair chance that it will survive. As long as it doesnt land directly on either vertical end on a point, since the bass radiator in each end is exposed and has no casing over it."", ""The buttons definitely feel like military-grade or something. They are bizarrely hard to press. Just hold an actual rock in your hand, and start squeezing that rock. Pretend that the solid rock has imaginary buttons recessed into its side. Pretend that you are trying to push those buttons inward with your fingertips. Thats how hard it is to push these buttons on the side of this speaker. Drop this thing into the North Atlantic so it sinks down next to the Titanic, and the extremely intense water pressure down there might not even faze these buttons."", ""For a comparison of the sound quality, I think its pretty similar to my old Bluetooth speaker that was shaped like a lone triangle. The angular one. And I really liked that one back in the day, so thats saying something. Compared to Echo smart speakers, it sounds much, much better than my Echo Dot (4tj Gen), but not as good or as loud as my regular Echo (4th Gen). For the money, Im happy to go with this instead of blowing much more money on another brand that probably doesnt even sound much better than this.

My Clip 3 has been a great speaker—Ill probably keep finding uses for it until it wont hold a charge anymore, hopefully not anytime soon—but honestly...I really wanted to upgrade because its one of the last devices I own with a Micro USB connector for charging."", ""Anyways, the Clip 4 has turned out to be a noticeably better speaker. Reading over JBLs own writings about the Clip 3 and 4, it seems like version 4 incorporates a passive radiator (like their larger portable speakers), which explains the much improved bass and low-midrange clarity. It wont fool anyone at high volumes, but for low volume playback in a quiet space—which is what I always used my Clip 3 for anyways—it does manage to sound a bit larger than its size suggests it should."", ""My Clip 3 is a noisy speaker; with no audio playing, theres always some low-level hissing thats clearly audible if its close enough to the ear. It also seems to impart a barely perceptible crunchy distortion onto everything I play through it. The Clip 4, on the other hand, is dead silent when nothing is playing, and doesnt have that gritty veil of distortion over the upper-mids and treble frequencies; possibly a side effect of the 3.5mm TRS input being removed."", The titular clip on version 4 has a slightly wider opening, and the larger space inside the clip makes it easier to maneuver onto some things I couldn't get the Clip 3's carabiner over. At the narrowest point, the Clip 4's opening measures about 5/8"" wide, only slightly larger than the Clip 3's 9/16"" opening., Now for the downsides:, ""The Clip 4s power and pairing buttons are much easier to press (i.e., accidentally) than the recessed buttons on the side of the Clip 3. Not a huge issue if its sitting or hanging somewhere solid and stationary, but I could imagine that it might turn itself on/off or go into pairing mode if its swinging around on a backpack or something. I put mine into pairing mode by mistake twice while handling it to measure the carabiner opening."", Of course, I have to mention the loss of the analog input. I admit that I rarely ever use(d) it on the Clip 3, but it was indispensable when I needed it in a pinch., ""The USB Type-C port does not have a dust cover; another omission from the Clip 3s design. I never cared for it, but its worth mentioning if you use yours in dusty or wet environments. Maybe not a huge issue, since the Clip 4 carries an IP67 rating."", ""Finally, the carabiner clip just doesnt feel as sturdy. Version 4 appears to use some kind of plastic hinge, where the Clip 3s was made of anodized aluminum like the rest of the hook. It may well hold up for years just like the previous version, but only time will tell."", ""Overall, The Clip 4 is a respectable step-up in sound quality, with a few odd design changes from version 3 that may or may not make it less reliable, depending on how you intend to use it. For my use case—quietly listening to music and podcasts in bed, or during power outages when I cant use my hi-fi—it fits the bill perfectly so far."", Oh, and one last thing: this ""Grey"" color scheme is properly weird. The aluminum parts are a kind of golden orange, the plastic clip and button accents are what I can only describe as ""puce,"" and the JBL logo is some kind of desaturated teal color. It looks so strange that it's almost bad, but I love it.","{'feature': 'compatibility of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The USB Type-C port does not have a dust cover; another omission from the Clip 3s design.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the USB Type-C port of the speaker does not have a dust cover and it is an omission from the Clip 3s design.', 'sentiment': 'negative'}",compatibility,The user mentioned that the USB Type-C port of the speaker does not have a dust cover and it is an omission from the Clip 3s design.,,"The USB Type-C port of the speaker lacks a dust cover, which is an omission from the Clip 3s design.",yes

I have in front of me now the Flip 6, Xtreme 2 and Xtreme 3.  I started with the Flip 6, to replace some aging Bose soundlink Micros (Flip 6 is way better than both Bose Micro and Flex, IMO).  Overall, of the three the Flip 6 is the best bang for the buck...great range of sound, decent volume and bass for indoor use.  Does distort a little at max volume.  I then got the Xtreme 3 with high hopes.  It has tremendously crisp highs, deep lows, but it is VERY lacking in the midrange...the sound feels hollow, empty.  Might be OK for synthetic music, but for anything instrumental I was disappointed.  What I did find is if you pair the Flip 6 with the Xtreme 3 in party mode, they together sound very good.  The Flip 6 fills the holes in the sound of the Xtreme 3, the Xtreme 3 expands the sound of the Flip 6.  A great pairing...but now you need two speakers.  So then I got the Xtreme 2...which I will be keeping instead of the Xtreme 3.  The treble isnt as crisp, the base maybe not quite as low, but it has good midrange, a much more balanced sound.  A good way to explain it might be that the Xtreme 3 is better for drums/beats but the Xtreme 2 is better for bass and rhythm guitar.  I wish that the Xtreme 2 could do party mode with the Flip 6, I bet that would be awesome, but the Xtreme 2 doesnt pair with the newer ones.  The Flip 6 I think has slightly better range than the Xtreme 2, but it isnt as powerful sounding.  Xtreme 2 gets louder and doesnt seem to distort at high volume.  In conclusion, from my perspective:  the Flip 6 is the better overall, bang for the buck, for indoor use.  The Xtreme 2 is really good, would take if over the Flip 6 for outdoors and wouldnt be sad to have it in the house.  The Xtreme 3 alone is just plain lacking...but if used in conjunction with the Flip 6,together are quite good.

Might be OK for synthetic music, but for anything instrumental I was disappointed.  What I did find is if you pair the Flip 6 with the Xtreme 3 in party mode, they together sound very good.  The Flip 6 fills the holes in the sound of the Xtreme 3, the Xtreme 3 expands the sound of the Flip 6.  A great pairing...but now you need two speakers.  So then I got the Xtreme 2...which I will be keeping instead of the Xtreme 3.  The treble isnt as crisp, the base maybe not quite as low, but it has good midrange, a much more balanced sound.  A good way to explain it might be that the Xtreme 3 is better for drums/beats but the Xtreme 2 is better for bass and rhythm guitar.  I wish that the Xtreme 2 could do party mode with the Flip 6, I bet that would be awesome, but the Xtreme 2 doesnt pair with the newer ones.  The Flip 6 I think has slightly better range than the Xtreme 2, but it isnt as powerful sounding.  Xtreme 2 gets louder and doesnt seem to distort at high volume.  In conclusion, from my perspective:  the Flip 6 is the better overall, bang for the buck, for indoor use.  The Xtreme 2 is really good, would take if over the Flip 6 for outdoors and wouldnt be sad to have it in the house.  The Xtreme 3 alone is just plain lacking...but if used in conjunction with the Flip 6,together are quite good.  Xtreme 3 plus Flip 6 is louder and crisper than Xtreme 2 alone, a bit better range but not as powerful of a tone and still not as balanced in the mids.""","{'feature': 'connectivity range of wireless-bluetooth-speakers', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The Flip 6 I think has slightly better range than the Xtreme 2, but it isnt as powerful sounding.
