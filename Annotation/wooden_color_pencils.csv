Plus, the ‘wood’ if it really is real wood does not ‘shave’ off cleanly. After taking off ¾” or more and still not getting a ‘clean’ point, I simply gave up on this. No – I seldom use an ‘electric’ sharpener and instead use manuals with German steel blades, which I learned about years ago…., Besides the ‘sharpening’ issue, I played with some blending techniques, with this ‘new’ set. I’m not sure, but the Prang formula is not the same – These ‘new’ pencils do not blend as the well and the colors are not the same. Perhaps, this is due to the fact, that the production has now been moved off-shore to China and no longer in the USA and Mexico, as were the ‘old’ Prangs. Also, those ‘shades’ – ‘colors’ I needed to replace, they are not the same vibrant’s or tone, nor do they ‘blend’ as smoothly or evenly as the ‘old’ ones. This being tested with quality blending pencils and lighter-fluid, my preferred methods I use various weights of paper 60 – 90 pds – normally bright white – slight-to-medium ‘tooth’ for my art work/colorings., I also quickly found that I did not get a true “72” count of colors, but instead ended up with a fair amount of duplicates…  “What” I asked. There is not ‘72’ separate/individual colors within this pack.

And with this set, one does not get a ‘number’ and/or ‘name’ of the individual pencil itself regarding its color???

They wear down a bit quicker than normal pencils because they are softer but that is what makes them so satsifying to draw with.

As a result, I was never able to get a truly sharp point on them, which is what I needed them for - detail marks., Especially with their higher price, I feel like a lot of money was wasted (in the trash with attempts at sharpening) just because of the wood choice/size, not the pastel part itself.

The range of colours is very good for nature, botanicals and portraiture. The softer feel of watercolour pencils suits me well and I find them much easier for blending even though I seldom use water - though I do use a little moisture here and there for glass and liquid effects. They hold a good fine point and seldom break.","{'feature': 'blendability of wooden-colored-pencils', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'I find them much easier for blending even though I seldom use water - though I do use a little moisture here and there for glass and liquid effects', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the pencils are easy to blend, even though he seldom uses water, and he uses a little moisture here and there for glass and liquid effects.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",blendability,"The user mentioned that the pencils are easy to blend, even though he seldom uses water, and he uses a little moisture here and there for glass and liquid effects.",,"I find the pencils easy to blend, even without water.

These glide so smoothly over the paper without any drag or missing.  

While they are more expensive than other pencils.

I think the quality speaks for itself when used.  

The choice of colors is generous and blending them is a piece of cake.  

Best pencils, bar none.""","{'feature': 'blendability of wooden-colored-pencils', 'actual_sentence_extracted': 'The choice of colors is generous and blending them is a piece of cake.', 'rephrased_it(without experience & observation)': 'The user mentioned that the choice of colors is generous and blending them is very easy.', 'sentiment': 'positive'}",blendability,The user mentioned that the choice of colors is generous and blending them is very easy.,,Blending the generous choice of colors is very easy.,492075,YES,Blending the generous choice of colors is very easy.,30,399575,2024-06-05T07:03:25.126431Z,2024-06-05T07:03:25.126484Z,5.487,OTHER,different
